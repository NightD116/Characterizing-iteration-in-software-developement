This means democratizing Computer Science education; make it accessible to everyone. Accessibility doesn\'t mean only providing the required material (i.e. courses) for free, but also providing the road-map and guidance on certain issues that the beginner learner doesn\'t have the experience to know or consider. And this is what OSSU is achieving by providing the courses, the road-map and the mentoring in the form of detailed guidance [^2]. \r\n\r\nComputer Science as a discipline is a branch of mathematics. Most universities around the world assume that students who aim at studying Computer Science have finished high school Mathematics. The way mathematics is taught in high school is not the best way to teach it. In fact, i don\'t think that anyone knows what is the best way to teach it. Nonetheless it remains a fact that many students who hate mathematics - because of a bad teacher, or the subject is presented in a way that doesn\'t reflect the true nature of Mathematics - are not in fact bad at Mathematics. This means that if the way Mathematics is presented in high schools changed, many\'ll find it an appealing and natural subject to learn [^3]; they\'ll become good at it. Changing the way Mathematics is presented in High Schools means introducing Mathematics when needed, not as a bunch of facts and techniques that the student should master; but as a tool for interpreting, solving, and expressing problems. In short, introduce Mathematics in relation to some problem, in the light of, or in context of something related to the field you study - which is CS in our case.\r\n\r\nGiven the above, and given the good intention of OSSU creators to advance humanity by making Computer Science learning accessible to a greater number of people who\'re willing to put their time and effort to become Computer Scientists, I claim that there is an opportunity for OSSU to fix a problem related to teaching mathematics in formal education, and hence make the curriculum accessible to a greater number of people, some of which can become good at CS and Math but discouraged by the mathematics - the problem of teaching math as a bunch of facts or techniques produced by some people (i.e. mathematicians) that the students ought to master - by introducing math lately in the curriculum. \r\n\r\n**How this proposed solution will contribute to fixing the math teaching problem in formal education ?**\r\n\r\nBy the time the learner finish ""Intro CS"" they would\'ve been introduced to some mathematical concepts but in a superficial way. They\'d also have an answer to the question: Is CS my field of interest or not. This is in fact the function of an Intro Course; to give the learner enough knowledge in order to decide if they would like to purse more or that what they\'ve known is enough.\r\n\r\nFrom the three courses in ""Intro cs"" -  CS50P, Python for Everybody, 6.0001 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python - 6.0001 is the only course that introduce mathematical concepts because it\'s the only course that introduces CS. The other two courses are programming and not CS courses. \r\n\r\nFor instance, in 6.0001 the first appearance of mathematical concept is in ""Lec-3"" the cubic root of some number and the ""guess and check method""; The second appearance in ""Lec-10,11"" in the form of graphs of the running time of algorithms - constant, linear, log, ...etc. None of these require a whole knowledge and mastering of High School Math; they just need a simple search on google to understand what it means by cubic root. In terms of the graphs, the function of graphs in Mathematics in general is to express some Mathematical ideas visually. So, by only looking to the graphs the learner could see what constant mean visually and so on, also something that doesn\'t require mastering High School Math.\r\n\r\nMIT, the university that is issuing the course is an engineering university. In fact the Bachelor Degree of Computer Science at MIT is a Degree in Computer Science and Engineering [^4]. Hence, MIT assumes that their freshman students should have High School knowledge not only of math but of physics also. This is one of the reasons of why MIT is known for its hard admission exams and the way they filter their freshmen students.\r\n\r\nEvery higher education institution has a way to filter students through entrance examinations - SAT, MCAT, ...etc. The reason that this is the case in higher education is because every college and university have a finite number of places for students - a situation which online MOOC education doesn\'t face - and the growth in higher education made an intense competition for seats [^5]. Therefore, filtering out students doesn\'t have any meaning in MOOC settings. In fact the opposite is true. MOOC is intended to everyone that is willing to invest their effort and time regardless of their background. Even if they didn\'t attend High School all together.\r\n\r\n6.0001 Course itself - Not MIT, The University - doesn\'t require High School math as a prerequisite [^6]. The text-book recommended by the course itself is a book by Professor John Guttag, in the preface of the book there is no mentions to any prerequisite. In fact Professor John said ""The book is aimed at 1) readers with little or no prior programming experience who have a desire to understand computational approaches to problem solving, and 2) more experienced programmers who want to learn how to use computation to model things or explore data."" This second target audience of the book ""The experienced programmers"" are required to know, in Prof. John words ""[what is required is] no knowledge of mathematics beyond high school algebra, but do assume that the reader is comfortable with rigorous thinking and is not intimidated by mathematical concepts."" This requirement is needed for ""experienced programmers"" taking a second course in computer science, which is 6.0002, a course not in OSSU curriculum, and is not an introductory course. Professor John\'s book contains the material for teaching 6.0001 & 6.0002 [^7].  MIT in another place recommended prerequisite for this course 6.0001, which is in their words ""No prior programming experience is necessary to take, understand, or be successful in 6.0001. Familiarity with pre-calculus, especially series, will be helpful for some topics, but is not required to understand the majority of the content. [^8]"" The keywords here is ""Some Topics"" and ""Is not required to understand the majority of the content"". Does this means that MIT recommended pre-calculus and hence High School math as prerequisite for 6.0001 ? Yes. Does this mean that their is no other way to learn 6.0001 than learning the entirety of High School math ? No, because MIT themselves put this phrase ""Is not required to understand the majority of the content"" for a reason, to say, don\'t get discouraged to take this course if you don\'t have pre-calculus and hence High School math because ""[its] not required to understand the majority of content"". Is it then necessary to not take 6.0001 course until finishing High School Mathematics ? My answer is no. You can take the course and google the two concepts that will meet you.\r\n\r\n\r\n**What can be modified in the current OSSU Curriculum ?**\r\n\r\nI propose to move Mathematics Prerequisite to later in the Curriculum, to either directly before Core Programming, or to Directly before Core Mathematics. None of the Core Programming courses in fact require any Mathematics as a prerequisite. And prerequisites on Courcera, and in every other online learning platform or course, has to be said explicitly. \r\n\r\nIn fact the reason to take High School mathematics is because it\'s a prerequisite for calculus. But than we must ask why we learn calculus in Computer Science, or at least why before Discrete Math ? Some would answer, because Calculus is a prerequisite for Discrete Math. This is what MIT recommended, but again, MIT is engineering university with an intense competition for the number of students allowed to study at MIT. \r\n\r\nThis whole organization of Mathematics Curriculum in USA, and by implication in most of the world is questionable. Arithmetic, then Geometry, then Pre-Algebra, then High School Math (Pre-calculus), then calculus and discrete mathematics, is not the only why to learn mathematics; most of the people can learn Mathematics to even Higher Mathematics (Graduate level Mathematics) starting from Discrete Math or what we call ""Math for Computer Science""[^9]. However, this argument is not the scope of this discussion. I just put it forward for the sake of showing that what we take for granted about learning math is not necessary the best way to learn it. this is not my personal opinion, this is the opinion of many great mathematician, for instance, George Pólya, and The Mathematician and Philosopher, Imre Lakatos ([^3] for more details).\r\n\r\n**Final Words**\r\n\r\nI\'ll Finish with a quote from the philosopher, educator, encyclopedist, and popular author Mortimer J. Adler that i think is directed to anyone who is responsible for providing education for people especially MOOC education. \r\n""We are on record as holding that unlimited education opportunity-or, specking practically, education opportunity that is limited only by individual desire, ability, and need- is the most valuable service that society can provide for its members. That we don\'t know how to provide that kind of opportunity is no reason to give up the attempt.[^10]."" \r\n\r\n---\r\n[^1]: [Summary section, At OSSU GitHub page.](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/tree/bc733da3f452524ee3566e15d33b140bc6b6571a).\r\n[^2]: [For instance, giving two approaches for learning Operating Systems in a great detail](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/bc733da3f452524ee3566e15d33b140bc6b6571a/coursepages/ostep/README.md).\r\n[^3]: Li, Y., Schoenfeld, A.H.

This means democratizing Computer Science education; make it accessible to everyone. Accessibility doesn\'t mean only providing the required material (i.e. courses) for free, but also providing the road-map and guidance on certain issues that the beginner learner doesn\'t have the experience to know or consider. And this is what OSSU is achieving by providing the courses, the road-map and the mentoring in the form of detailed guidance [^2]. \r\n\r\nComputer Science as a discipline is a branch of mathematics. Most universities around the world assume that students who aim at studying Computer Science have finished high school Mathematics. The way mathematics is taught in high school is not the best way to teach it. In fact, i don\'t think that anyone knows what is the best way to teach it. Nonetheless it remains a fact that many students who hate mathematics - because of a bad teacher, or the subject is presented in a way that doesn\'t reflect the true nature of Mathematics - are not in fact bad at Mathematics. This means that if the way Mathematics is presented in high schools changed, many\'ll find it an appealing and natural subject to learn [^3]; they\'ll become good at it. Changing the way Mathematics is presented in High Schools means introducing Mathematics when needed, not as a bunch of facts and techniques that the student should master; but as a tool for interpreting, solving, and expressing problems. In short, introduce Mathematics in relation to some problem, in the light of, or in context of something related to the field you study - which is CS in our case.\r\n\r\nGiven the above, and given the good intention of OSSU creators to advance humanity by making Computer Science learning accessible to a greater number of people who\'re willing to put their time and effort to become Computer Scientists, I claim that there is an opportunity for OSSU to fix a problem related to teaching mathematics in formal education, and hence make the curriculum accessible to a greater number of people, some of which can become good at CS and Math but discouraged by the mathematics - the problem of teaching math as a bunch of facts or techniques produced by some people (i.e. mathematicians) that the students ought to master - by introducing math lately in the curriculum. \r\n\r\n**How this proposed solution will contribute to fixing the math teaching problem in formal education ?**\r\n\r\nBy the time the learner finish ""Intro CS"" they would\'ve been introduced to some mathematical concepts but in a superficial way. They\'d also have an answer to the question: Is CS my field of interest or not. This is in fact the function of an Intro Course; to give the learner enough knowledge in order to decide if they would like to purse more or that what they\'ve known is enough.\r\n\r\nFrom the three courses in ""Intro cs"" -  CS50P, Python for Everybody, 6.0001 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python - 6.0001 is the only course that introduce mathematical concepts because it\'s the only course that introduces CS. The other two courses are programming and not CS courses. \r\n\r\nFor instance, in 6.0001 the first appearance of mathematical concept is in ""Lec-3"" the cubic root of some number and the ""guess and check method""; The second appearance in ""Lec-10,11"" in the form of graphs of the running time of algorithms - constant, linear, log, ...etc. None of these require a whole knowledge and mastering of High School Math; they just need a simple search on google to understand what it means by cubic root. In terms of the graphs, the function of graphs in Mathematics in general is to express some Mathematical ideas visually. So, by only looking to the graphs the learner could see what constant mean visually and so on, also something that doesn\'t require mastering High School Math.\r\n\r\nMIT, the university that is issuing the course is an engineering university. In fact the Bachelor Degree of Computer Science at MIT is a Degree in Computer Science and Engineering [^4]. Hence, MIT assumes that their freshman students should have High School knowledge not only of math but of physics also. This is one of the reasons of why MIT is known for its hard admission exams and the way they filter their freshmen students.\r\n\r\nEvery higher education institution has a way to filter students through entrance examinations - SAT, MCAT, ...etc. The reason that this is the case in higher education is because every college and university have a finite number of places for students - a situation which online MOOC education doesn\'t face - and the growth in higher education made an intense competition for seats [^5]. Therefore, filtering out students doesn\'t have any meaning in MOOC settings. In fact the opposite is true. MOOC is intended to everyone that is willing to invest their effort and time regardless of their background. Even if they didn\'t attend High School all together.\r\n\r\n6.0001 Course itself - Not MIT, The University - doesn\'t require High School math as a prerequisite [^6]. The text-book recommended by the course itself is a book by Professor John Guttag, in the preface of the book there is no mentions to any prerequisite. In fact Professor John said ""The book is aimed at 1) readers with little or no prior programming experience who have a desire to understand computational approaches to problem solving, and 2) more experienced programmers who want to learn how to use computation to model things or explore data."" This second target audience of the book ""The experienced programmers"" are required to know, in Prof. John words ""[what is required is] no knowledge of mathematics beyond high school algebra, but do assume that the reader is comfortable with rigorous thinking and is not intimidated by mathematical concepts."" This requirement is needed for ""experienced programmers"" taking a second course in computer science, which is 6.0002, a course not in OSSU curriculum, and is not an introductory course. Professor John\'s book contains the material for teaching 6.0001 & 6.0002 [^7].  MIT in another place recommended prerequisite for this course 6.0001, which is in their words ""No prior programming experience is necessary to take, understand, or be successful in 6.0001. Familiarity with pre-calculus, especially series, will be helpful for some topics, but is not required to understand the majority of the content. [^8]"" The keywords here is ""Some Topics"" and ""Is not required to understand the majority of the content"". Does this means that MIT recommended pre-calculus and hence High School math as prerequisite for 6.0001 ? Yes. Does this mean that their is no other way to learn 6.0001 than learning the entirety of High School math ? No, because MIT themselves put this phrase ""Is not required to understand the majority of the content"" for a reason, to say, don\'t get discouraged to take this course if you don\'t have pre-calculus and hence High School math because ""[its] not required to understand the majority of content"". Is it then necessary to not take 6.0001 course until finishing High School Mathematics ? My answer is no. You can take the course and google the two concepts that will meet you.\r\n\r\n\r\n**What can be modified in the current OSSU Curriculum ?**\r\n\r\nI propose to move Mathematics Prerequisite to later in the Curriculum, to either directly before Core Programming, or to Directly before Core Mathematics. None of the Core Programming courses in fact require any Mathematics as a prerequisite. And prerequisites on Courcera, and in every other online learning platform or course, has to be said explicitly. \r\n\r\nIn fact the reason to take High School mathematics is because it\'s a prerequisite for calculus. But than we must ask why we learn calculus in Computer Science, or at least why before Discrete Math ? Some would answer, because Calculus is a prerequisite for Discrete Math. This is what MIT recommended, but again, MIT is engineering university with an intense competition for the number of students allowed to study at MIT. \r\n\r\nThis whole organization of Mathematics Curriculum in USA, and by implication in most of the world is questionable. Arithmetic, then Geometry, then Pre-Algebra, then High School Math (Pre-calculus), then calculus and discrete mathematics, is not the only why to learn mathematics; most of the people can learn Mathematics to even Higher Mathematics (Graduate level Mathematics) starting from Discrete Math or what we call ""Math for Computer Science""[^9]. However, this argument is not the scope of this discussion. I just put it forward for the sake of showing that what we take for granted about learning math is not necessary the best way to learn it. this is not my personal opinion, this is the opinion of many great mathematician, for instance, George Pólya, and The Mathematician and Philosopher, Imre Lakatos ([^3] for more details).\r\n\r\n**Final Words**\r\n\r\nI\'ll Finish with a quote from the philosopher, educator, encyclopedist, and popular author Mortimer J. Adler that i think is directed to anyone who is responsible for providing education for people especially MOOC education. \r\n""We are on record as holding that unlimited education opportunity-or, specking practically, education opportunity that is limited only by individual desire, ability, and need- is the most valuable service that society can provide for its members. That we don\'t know how to provide that kind of opportunity is no reason to give up the attempt.[^10]."" \r\n\r\n---\r\n[^1]: [Summary section, At OSSU GitHub page.](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/tree/bc733da3f452524ee3566e15d33b140bc6b6571a).\r\n[^2]: [For instance, giving two approaches for learning Operating Systems in a great detail](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/bc733da3f452524ee3566e15d33b140bc6b6571a/coursepages/ostep/README.md).\r\n[^3]: Li, Y., Schoenfeld, A.H.

Saying that only Edx version requires high school math does not really make any sense.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n@BurzumBlack \r\n\r\n> If there is a prerequisite needed for the introductory material, he would write about it. He did when it was required in advanced topics.\r\n\r\nI have seen many Math textbooks not mentioning any prerequisites. It does not mean that it does not have any prerequisite.\r\n\r\n> The archived version recommended by OSSU doesn't require any prerequisite. If anyone find any prerequisite required - on the archived version recommended by OSSU - please inform me.\r\n\r\nThe archived version recommended by OSSU is just an archive of the normal Edx course. It is not different in any way.\r\n\r\n> In fact anyone who took this course knows that you can master it without the need to master High School Math.\r\n\r\nMe and all the people who opposed this idea on Discord have also completed the course. The OSSU maintainers who added the prerequisite section also probably had done the course before.\r\n\r\n> One of his critical points is that most of the people (The Commite) responsible for putting together Computer Science Curriculum, comes from an abstract mathematics background, and therefore they put too much emphasis on Mathematics to the extend that they confuse the learners. The argument comes not from a theorist but from a Computer Science PhD.\r\n\r\nThis is not the place to have this argument. OSSU follows the Curricular guidelines. OSSU does not decide what should be taught.\r\n\r\n> Encourage the learner to love the discipline first, and then present them with all the math that's required. This is my whole point.\r\n\r\nThat should not be done. The point of an Intro CS course is to introduce people to the discipline of CS, and math is an integral part of that. OSSU does not exist to lure people into studying computer science (And people who will stop learning CS because the Intro CS course requires high school math, will stop learning CS the moment they encounter high school math at any point, anyway).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAt last, OSSU is not tied to what MIT says about prerequisites. Nand2Tetris claims to have no prerequisite, but that is not actually the case practically. OSSU mentions prerequisites in its case anyway.\r\n\r\nAlso, OSSU is already very lenient regarding math requirements, and I think that is enough not to discourage people. Typical CS degrees involve way more math than OSSU."", 'reactions': {'url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/ossu/computer-science/issues/comments/2040358687/reactions', 'total_count': 0, '+1': 0, '-1': 0, 'laugh': 0, 'hooray': 0, 'confused': 0, 'heart': 0, 'rocket': 0, 'eyes': 0}, 'performed_via_github_app': None}}"

This means democratizing Computer Science education; make it accessible to everyone. Accessibility doesn\'t mean only providing the required material (i.e. courses) for free, but also providing the road-map and guidance on certain issues that the beginner learner doesn\'t have the experience to know or consider. And this is what OSSU is achieving by providing the courses, the road-map and the mentoring in the form of detailed guidance [^2]. \r\n\r\nComputer Science as a discipline is a branch of mathematics. Most universities around the world assume that students who aim at studying Computer Science have finished high school Mathematics. The way mathematics is taught in high school is not the best way to teach it. In fact, i don\'t think that anyone knows what is the best way to teach it. Nonetheless it remains a fact that many students who hate mathematics - because of a bad teacher, or the subject is presented in a way that doesn\'t reflect the true nature of Mathematics - are not in fact bad at Mathematics. This means that if the way Mathematics is presented in high schools changed, many\'ll find it an appealing and natural subject to learn [^3]; they\'ll become good at it. Changing the way Mathematics is presented in High Schools means introducing Mathematics when needed, not as a bunch of facts and techniques that the student should master; but as a tool for interpreting, solving, and expressing problems. In short, introduce Mathematics in relation to some problem, in the light of, or in context of something related to the field you study - which is CS in our case.\r\n\r\nGiven the above, and given the good intention of OSSU creators to advance humanity by making Computer Science learning accessible to a greater number of people who\'re willing to put their time and effort to become Computer Scientists, I claim that there is an opportunity for OSSU to fix a problem related to teaching mathematics in formal education, and hence make the curriculum accessible to a greater number of people, some of which can become good at CS and Math but discouraged by the mathematics - the problem of teaching math as a bunch of facts or techniques produced by some people (i.e. mathematicians) that the students ought to master - by introducing math lately in the curriculum. \r\n\r\n**How this proposed solution will contribute to fixing the math teaching problem in formal education ?**\r\n\r\nBy the time the learner finish ""Intro CS"" they would\'ve been introduced to some mathematical concepts but in a superficial way. They\'d also have an answer to the question: Is CS my field of interest or not. This is in fact the function of an Intro Course; to give the learner enough knowledge in order to decide if they would like to purse more or that what they\'ve known is enough.\r\n\r\nFrom the three courses in ""Intro cs"" -  CS50P, Python for Everybody, 6.0001 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python - 6.0001 is the only course that introduce mathematical concepts because it\'s the only course that introduces CS. The other two courses are programming and not CS courses. \r\n\r\nFor instance, in 6.0001 the first appearance of mathematical concept is in ""Lec-3"" the cubic root of some number and the ""guess and check method""; The second appearance in ""Lec-10,11"" in the form of graphs of the running time of algorithms - constant, linear, log, ...etc. None of these require a whole knowledge and mastering of High School Math; they just need a simple search on google to understand what it means by cubic root. In terms of the graphs, the function of graphs in Mathematics in general is to express some Mathematical ideas visually. So, by only looking to the graphs the learner could see what constant mean visually and so on, also something that doesn\'t require mastering High School Math.\r\n\r\nMIT, the university that is issuing the course is an engineering university. In fact the Bachelor Degree of Computer Science at MIT is a Degree in Computer Science and Engineering [^4]. Hence, MIT assumes that their freshman students should have High School knowledge not only of math but of physics also. This is one of the reasons of why MIT is known for its hard admission exams and the way they filter their freshmen students.\r\n\r\nEvery higher education institution has a way to filter students through entrance examinations - SAT, MCAT, ...etc. The reason that this is the case in higher education is because every college and university have a finite number of places for students - a situation which online MOOC education doesn\'t face - and the growth in higher education made an intense competition for seats [^5]. Therefore, filtering out students doesn\'t have any meaning in MOOC settings. In fact the opposite is true. MOOC is intended to everyone that is willing to invest their effort and time regardless of their background. Even if they didn\'t attend High School all together.\r\n\r\n6.0001 Course itself - Not MIT, The University - doesn\'t require High School math as a prerequisite [^6]. The text-book recommended by the course itself is a book by Professor John Guttag, in the preface of the book there is no mentions to any prerequisite. In fact Professor John said ""The book is aimed at 1) readers with little or no prior programming experience who have a desire to understand computational approaches to problem solving, and 2) more experienced programmers who want to learn how to use computation to model things or explore data."" This second target audience of the book ""The experienced programmers"" are required to know, in Prof. John words ""[what is required is] no knowledge of mathematics beyond high school algebra, but do assume that the reader is comfortable with rigorous thinking and is not intimidated by mathematical concepts."" This requirement is needed for ""experienced programmers"" taking a second course in computer science, which is 6.0002, a course not in OSSU curriculum, and is not an introductory course. Professor John\'s book contains the material for teaching 6.0001 & 6.0002 [^7].  MIT in another place recommended prerequisite for this course 6.0001, which is in their words ""No prior programming experience is necessary to take, understand, or be successful in 6.0001. Familiarity with pre-calculus, especially series, will be helpful for some topics, but is not required to understand the majority of the content. [^8]"" The keywords here is ""Some Topics"" and ""Is not required to understand the majority of the content"". Does this means that MIT recommended pre-calculus and hence High School math as prerequisite for 6.0001 ? Yes. Does this mean that their is no other way to learn 6.0001 than learning the entirety of High School math ? No, because MIT themselves put this phrase ""Is not required to understand the majority of the content"" for a reason, to say, don\'t get discouraged to take this course if you don\'t have pre-calculus and hence High School math because ""[its] not required to understand the majority of content"". Is it then necessary to not take 6.0001 course until finishing High School Mathematics ? My answer is no. You can take the course and google the two concepts that will meet you.\r\n\r\n\r\n**What can be modified in the current OSSU Curriculum ?**\r\n\r\nI propose to move Mathematics Prerequisite to later in the Curriculum, to either directly before Core Programming, or to Directly before Core Mathematics. None of the Core Programming courses in fact require any Mathematics as a prerequisite. And prerequisites on Courcera, and in every other online learning platform or course, has to be said explicitly. \r\n\r\nIn fact the reason to take High School mathematics is because it\'s a prerequisite for calculus. But than we must ask why we learn calculus in Computer Science, or at least why before Discrete Math ? Some would answer, because Calculus is a prerequisite for Discrete Math. This is what MIT recommended, but again, MIT is engineering university with an intense competition for the number of students allowed to study at MIT. \r\n\r\nThis whole organization of Mathematics Curriculum in USA, and by implication in most of the world is questionable. Arithmetic, then Geometry, then Pre-Algebra, then High School Math (Pre-calculus), then calculus and discrete mathematics, is not the only why to learn mathematics; most of the people can learn Mathematics to even Higher Mathematics (Graduate level Mathematics) starting from Discrete Math or what we call ""Math for Computer Science""[^9]. However, this argument is not the scope of this discussion. I just put it forward for the sake of showing that what we take for granted about learning math is not necessary the best way to learn it. this is not my personal opinion, this is the opinion of many great mathematician, for instance, George Pólya, and The Mathematician and Philosopher, Imre Lakatos ([^3] for more details).\r\n\r\n**Final Words**\r\n\r\nI\'ll Finish with a quote from the philosopher, educator, encyclopedist, and popular author Mortimer J. Adler that i think is directed to anyone who is responsible for providing education for people especially MOOC education. \r\n""We are on record as holding that unlimited education opportunity-or, specking practically, education opportunity that is limited only by individual desire, ability, and need- is the most valuable service that society can provide for its members. That we don\'t know how to provide that kind of opportunity is no reason to give up the attempt.[^10]."" \r\n\r\n---\r\n[^1]: [Summary section, At OSSU GitHub page.](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/tree/bc733da3f452524ee3566e15d33b140bc6b6571a).\r\n[^2]: [For instance, giving two approaches for learning Operating Systems in a great detail](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/bc733da3f452524ee3566e15d33b140bc6b6571a/coursepages/ostep/README.md).\r\n[^3]: Li, Y., Schoenfeld, A.H.

If not, then that\'s okay too because you can pick it up as you go along."" This makes a lot more sense according to the site you link, which has ""instructor\'s permission"" as one of the prerequisites of the other classes. Those requirements are for MIT students, and MIT students only. That is also the reason why the edX version has different prerequisites, as it is intended more towards a general audience. Therefore, I would strongly suggest edX\'s recommendation.\r\n\r\nYes MIT has different requirements for its freshman students as a result of the fact that it\'s an engineering university. OCW website - the website that my link refer to - is not a website that is intended exclusively for MIT students; in fact the opposite is true.\r\n> MIT OpenCourseWare (OCW) is a web-based publication of virtually all MIT course content. OCW is open and available to the world and is a permanent MIT activity. (https://mitocw.ups.edu.ec/about/)\r\n\r\nTherefore, what is existing at the OCW is intended for both the public and MIT students.\r\n\r\nSo we\'ve two things here: \r\n1. MIT Students with their admission requirements (which necessary for them since they are entering Electrical Engineering and Computer Science).\r\n2. OSSU learners which came from different backgrounds and having different goals from those of the MIT students.\r\nSo on OCW when they say that 6.0002 Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science Course require:\r\n>**Prerequisites:** [6.0001 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python](https://mitocw.ups.edu.ec/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016) or permission of instructor.\r\n\r\nThat permission of instructor part is related to MIT students. Nothing can stop anyone from the public that\'s using OCW not to take 6.0002 even if they doesn\'t satisfy the requirement. So, when MIT consider a prerequisite, they have two sets of audience in mind; the public, and their students.\r\nWhen MIT at its OCW website - which is intended for public audience - makes the course\'s prerequisite flexible. We shouldn\'t be very quick at coming to the conclusion that they are assuming from their students High School Math; they\'re not intending their students primary by the OCW. \r\n\r\nThe Course 6.0001 is not available now at edx. It\'ll open in may. I took edx\'s Course before and I reviewed the OCW. I challenge anyone to cite any Mathematical concepts introduced or used at 6.0001 other than the two I claimed they exist above, which are the cubic root, and the guess and check method; none of which require High School Math or Algebra. They require a basic search on google. This is a Computer Science Course, they used this concepts to introduce a problem to be solved Computationally, their choice of these two concepts is the result of the fact that they are Engineering University providing introductory CS Course for Engineers of MIT (and now accidentally) for the public who are not and doesn\'t plan to become Electrical engineers. Harvard CS50\'s Course doesn\'t introduce any mathematical concepts as their problems. But their problems are more in the humanities side. Every university colors the problems they use to introduce CS concepts with its academic nature. So, what\'s used to introduce a Computational concept, shouldn\'t become the learners main concern; the Computational concept itself is the aim. The thing that is used being a Mathematical concept, Super Mario game, or a dictionary of phone numbers, is a mean to some end, that is, the computation.\r\n\r\nThe archived version recommended by OSSU doesn\'t require any prerequisite. If anyone find any prerequisite required - on the archived version recommended by OSSU - please inform me. \r\n\r\nProfessor John Guttag is the author of the book that is used in the course and the . In the preface of the book he doesn\'t require any prerequisite from the reader:\r\n> The main goal of this book is to help readers become skillful at making productive use of computational techniques. They should learn to use computational modes of thoughts to frame problems, to build computational models, and to guide the process of extracting information from data. The primary knowledge they will take away from this book is the art of computational problem solving.\r\n\r\nHowever he wrote the book to cover two courses; 6.0001 and 6.0002. So, in the same preface but after one page he required a prerequisite from readers who are aimed to read the whole book (i.e. take 6.0001 & 6.0002 Cources):\r\n> Chapters 14-26 are about using computation to help understand the real world. They cover material that we think should become the usual second course in a computer science curriculum. They assume no knowledge of mathematics beyond high school algebra, but do assume that the reader is comfortable with rigorous thinking and is not intimidated by mathematical concepts.\r\n\r\nIf there is a prerequisite needed for the introductory material, he would write about it. He did when it was required in advanced topics.\r\n\r\nWhy the same material presented in different medium would require different prerequisite ? \r\nI Don\'t know. But I think that Professor John realized when he started to write the book that it\'s not really important to know High School Math or Algebra before talking it. He wanted to widen his audiences. This an opinion, not something i know for sure.\r\n\r\n> All in all, I strongly agree with this sentiment. Although my approach would be something akin to what @CodeCruncherTimmy mentioned. It would be for OSSU to simply expand their Prerequisites section (I think @pulkitkrishna00 is interested in doing this). In that prerequisites section, we should have a different and gentler introduction to computer science. Something like Berkeley\'s CS10: The Beauty and Joy of Computing. That class is geared towards high school students to undergrad non-majors, and gentle enough not to scare newcomers away from mathematical complexity. You can take a look at their content here: https://cs10.org/sp24/\r\n\r\nExpanding the prerequisites, in my opinion, would complicate not simplify the issue. We need to minimize the friction that a beginner learner would encounter in Computer Science, but we don\'t want to remove the friction. Learning, specially in depth, is not an easy task. But its not impossible.\r\n\r\nBy the time the learner would finish ""Python for Everyone"" or ""Harvard\'s Python course"" they\'ll be ready to take 6.0001. They would have gained a great deal of python\'s syntax and semantics, that when they take 6.0001 Course they\'ll concentrate more on Computational thinking which is the aim of 6.0001. The order of this introductory courses, in my opinion, is perfect.\r\n\r\nWhat is needed is to write a note at FAQ. or in other place summarize what we\'ve discovered together here. That what we recommend as a path is not the only way; this is one way of doing it. Another path - if you\'re not a math person, or wrongly think that - is to take High School Math, Calculus, then Mathematics for Computer Science. In short, to put High School math where it belong, in the Core Mathematics. By doing that, we\'re giving the student an opportunity to appreciate and love Computer Science as a discipline, assuming that if we achieved that task, the learner love and passion for the field will carry them forward in their quest. We can even give justifications for why you need to study Math in Computer Science. How you gonna use it to write proofs to analyze, or convince another Computer Scientist that your proposed algorithm is the fastest. If you decided to learn about Computer Graphics you need to learn Linear Algebra Because expressing a scene in terms of coordinates is equivalent to expressing it in terms of vectors, which is the topic of linear algebra. Even if the learner won\'t be convinced and decided to take a computer graphics course without taking linear algebra, once they hit a wall, they\'ll remember what OSSU recommended and then everything will become clear. At this stage the learner may decide to take Linear Algebra concurrently with Computer Graphics, or to pause Computer Graphics, finish Linear Algebra, and come back to it after that. But now all of this would have a meaning to the learner.\r\n\r\nGive more advice. I\'m open to the discussion. I\'m passionate about open education in general, Computer Science and OSSU specifically. This passion led me to spent in the last 48 hours more than 5 hours writing about that issue. \r\n', 'reactions': {'url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/ossu/computer-science/issues/comments/2040082178/reactions', 'total_count': 0, '+1': 0, '-1': 0, 'laugh': 0, 'hooray': 0, 'confused': 0, 'heart': 0, 'rocket': 0, 'eyes': 0}, 'performed_via_github_app': None}}"

This means democratizing Computer Science education; make it accessible to everyone. Accessibility doesn\'t mean only providing the required material (i.e. courses) for free, but also providing the road-map and guidance on certain issues that the beginner learner doesn\'t have the experience to know or consider. And this is what OSSU is achieving by providing the courses, the road-map and the mentoring in the form of detailed guidance [^2]. \r\n\r\nComputer Science as a discipline is a branch of mathematics. Most universities around the world assume that students who aim at studying Computer Science have finished high school Mathematics. The way mathematics is taught in high school is not the best way to teach it. In fact, i don\'t think that anyone knows what is the best way to teach it. Nonetheless it remains a fact that many students who hate mathematics - because of a bad teacher, or the subject is presented in a way that doesn\'t reflect the true nature of Mathematics - are not in fact bad at Mathematics. This means that if the way Mathematics is presented in high schools changed, many\'ll find it an appealing and natural subject to learn [^3]; they\'ll become good at it. Changing the way Mathematics is presented in High Schools means introducing Mathematics when needed, not as a bunch of facts and techniques that the student should master; but as a tool for interpreting, solving, and expressing problems. In short, introduce Mathematics in relation to some problem, in the light of, or in context of something related to the field you study - which is CS in our case.\r\n\r\nGiven the above, and given the good intention of OSSU creators to advance humanity by making Computer Science learning accessible to a greater number of people who\'re willing to put their time and effort to become Computer Scientists, I claim that there is an opportunity for OSSU to fix a problem related to teaching mathematics in formal education, and hence make the curriculum accessible to a greater number of people, some of which can become good at CS and Math but discouraged by the mathematics - the problem of teaching math as a bunch of facts or techniques produced by some people (i.e. mathematicians) that the students ought to master - by introducing math lately in the curriculum. \r\n\r\n**How this proposed solution will contribute to fixing the math teaching problem in formal education ?**\r\n\r\nBy the time the learner finish ""Intro CS"" they would\'ve been introduced to some mathematical concepts but in a superficial way. They\'d also have an answer to the question: Is CS my field of interest or not. This is in fact the function of an Intro Course; to give the learner enough knowledge in order to decide if they would like to purse more or that what they\'ve known is enough.\r\n\r\nFrom the three courses in ""Intro cs"" -  CS50P, Python for Everybody, 6.0001 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python - 6.0001 is the only course that introduce mathematical concepts because it\'s the only course that introduces CS. The other two courses are programming and not CS courses. \r\n\r\nFor instance, in 6.0001 the first appearance of mathematical concept is in ""Lec-3"" the cubic root of some number and the ""guess and check method""; The second appearance in ""Lec-10,11"" in the form of graphs of the running time of algorithms - constant, linear, log, ...etc. None of these require a whole knowledge and mastering of High School Math; they just need a simple search on google to understand what it means by cubic root. In terms of the graphs, the function of graphs in Mathematics in general is to express some Mathematical ideas visually. So, by only looking to the graphs the learner could see what constant mean visually and so on, also something that doesn\'t require mastering High School Math.\r\n\r\nMIT, the university that is issuing the course is an engineering university. In fact the Bachelor Degree of Computer Science at MIT is a Degree in Computer Science and Engineering [^4]. Hence, MIT assumes that their freshman students should have High School knowledge not only of math but of physics also. This is one of the reasons of why MIT is known for its hard admission exams and the way they filter their freshmen students.\r\n\r\nEvery higher education institution has a way to filter students through entrance examinations - SAT, MCAT, ...etc. The reason that this is the case in higher education is because every college and university have a finite number of places for students - a situation which online MOOC education doesn\'t face - and the growth in higher education made an intense competition for seats [^5]. Therefore, filtering out students doesn\'t have any meaning in MOOC settings. In fact the opposite is true. MOOC is intended to everyone that is willing to invest their effort and time regardless of their background. Even if they didn\'t attend High School all together.\r\n\r\n6.0001 Course itself - Not MIT, The University - doesn\'t require High School math as a prerequisite [^6]. The text-book recommended by the course itself is a book by Professor John Guttag, in the preface of the book there is no mentions to any prerequisite. In fact Professor John said ""The book is aimed at 1) readers with little or no prior programming experience who have a desire to understand computational approaches to problem solving, and 2) more experienced programmers who want to learn how to use computation to model things or explore data."" This second target audience of the book ""The experienced programmers"" are required to know, in Prof. John words ""[what is required is] no knowledge of mathematics beyond high school algebra, but do assume that the reader is comfortable with rigorous thinking and is not intimidated by mathematical concepts."" This requirement is needed for ""experienced programmers"" taking a second course in computer science, which is 6.0002, a course not in OSSU curriculum, and is not an introductory course. Professor John\'s book contains the material for teaching 6.0001 & 6.0002 [^7].  MIT in another place recommended prerequisite for this course 6.0001, which is in their words ""No prior programming experience is necessary to take, understand, or be successful in 6.0001. Familiarity with pre-calculus, especially series, will be helpful for some topics, but is not required to understand the majority of the content. [^8]"" The keywords here is ""Some Topics"" and ""Is not required to understand the majority of the content"". Does this means that MIT recommended pre-calculus and hence High School math as prerequisite for 6.0001 ? Yes. Does this mean that their is no other way to learn 6.0001 than learning the entirety of High School math ? No, because MIT themselves put this phrase ""Is not required to understand the majority of the content"" for a reason, to say, don\'t get discouraged to take this course if you don\'t have pre-calculus and hence High School math because ""[its] not required to understand the majority of content"". Is it then necessary to not take 6.0001 course until finishing High School Mathematics ? My answer is no. You can take the course and google the two concepts that will meet you.\r\n\r\n\r\n**What can be modified in the current OSSU Curriculum ?**\r\n\r\nI propose to move Mathematics Prerequisite to later in the Curriculum, to either directly before Core Programming, or to Directly before Core Mathematics. None of the Core Programming courses in fact require any Mathematics as a prerequisite. And prerequisites on Courcera, and in every other online learning platform or course, has to be said explicitly. \r\n\r\nIn fact the reason to take High School mathematics is because it\'s a prerequisite for calculus. But than we must ask why we learn calculus in Computer Science, or at least why before Discrete Math ? Some would answer, because Calculus is a prerequisite for Discrete Math. This is what MIT recommended, but again, MIT is engineering university with an intense competition for the number of students allowed to study at MIT. \r\n\r\nThis whole organization of Mathematics Curriculum in USA, and by implication in most of the world is questionable. Arithmetic, then Geometry, then Pre-Algebra, then High School Math (Pre-calculus), then calculus and discrete mathematics, is not the only why to learn mathematics; most of the people can learn Mathematics to even Higher Mathematics (Graduate level Mathematics) starting from Discrete Math or what we call ""Math for Computer Science""[^9]. However, this argument is not the scope of this discussion. I just put it forward for the sake of showing that what we take for granted about learning math is not necessary the best way to learn it. this is not my personal opinion, this is the opinion of many great mathematician, for instance, George Pólya, and The Mathematician and Philosopher, Imre Lakatos ([^3] for more details).\r\n\r\n**Final Words**\r\n\r\nI\'ll Finish with a quote from the philosopher, educator, encyclopedist, and popular author Mortimer J. Adler that i think is directed to anyone who is responsible for providing education for people especially MOOC education. \r\n""We are on record as holding that unlimited education opportunity-or, specking practically, education opportunity that is limited only by individual desire, ability, and need- is the most valuable service that society can provide for its members. That we don\'t know how to provide that kind of opportunity is no reason to give up the attempt.[^10]."" \r\n\r\n---\r\n[^1]: [Summary section, At OSSU GitHub page.](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/tree/bc733da3f452524ee3566e15d33b140bc6b6571a).\r\n[^2]: [For instance, giving two approaches for learning Operating Systems in a great detail](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/bc733da3f452524ee3566e15d33b140bc6b6571a/coursepages/ostep/README.md).\r\n[^3]: Li, Y., Schoenfeld, A.H.

They want to say if you don\'t have a familiarity with Pre-calculus - which is trig & algebra - don\'t get discouraged because you\'ll understand ""the majority of content"".\r\n\r\nI think an important distinction to note here is that these are classes for MIT students. Fresh undegrads MIT students will absolutely know about precalculus already, as they at minimum need to have their AP Calculus done during high school, as per their instructions here: https://mitadmissions.org/apply/prepare/highschool/\r\n\r\n> Prerequisites: No prior programming experience is necessary to take, understand, or be successful in 6.0001. Familiarity with pre-calculus, especially series, will be helpful for some topics, but is not required to understand the majority of the content.\r\n\r\nHence, this would make more sense if this direction is more like, ""Hey, it would be nice if you review precalculus again before taking this course. If not, then that\'s okay too because you can pick it up as you go along."" This makes a lot more sense according to the site you link, which has ""instructor\'s permission"" as one of the prerequisites of the other classes. Those requirements are for MIT students, and MIT students only. That is also the reason why the edX version has different prerequisites, as it is intended more towards a general audience. Therefore, I would strongly suggest edX\'s recommendation. \r\n\r\n> Encourage the learner to love the discipline first, and then present them with all the math that\'s required. This is my whole point.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I strongly agree with this sentiment. Although my approach would be something akin to what @CodeCruncherTimmy mentioned. It would be for OSSU to simply expand their Prerequisites section (I think @pulkitkrishna00 is interested in doing this). In that prerequisites section, we should have a different and gentler introduction to computer science. Something like Berkeley\'s CS10: The Beauty and Joy of Computing. That class is geared towards high school students to undergrad non-majors, and gentle enough not to scare newcomers away from mathematical complexity.

This means democratizing Computer Science education; make it accessible to everyone. Accessibility doesn\'t mean only providing the required material (i.e. courses) for free, but also providing the road-map and guidance on certain issues that the beginner learner doesn\'t have the experience to know or consider. And this is what OSSU is achieving by providing the courses, the road-map and the mentoring in the form of detailed guidance [^2]. \r\n\r\nComputer Science as a discipline is a branch of mathematics. Most universities around the world assume that students who aim at studying Computer Science have finished high school Mathematics. The way mathematics is taught in high school is not the best way to teach it. In fact, i don\'t think that anyone knows what is the best way to teach it. Nonetheless it remains a fact that many students who hate mathematics - because of a bad teacher, or the subject is presented in a way that doesn\'t reflect the true nature of Mathematics - are not in fact bad at Mathematics. This means that if the way Mathematics is presented in high schools changed, many\'ll find it an appealing and natural subject to learn [^3]; they\'ll become good at it. Changing the way Mathematics is presented in High Schools means introducing Mathematics when needed, not as a bunch of facts and techniques that the student should master; but as a tool for interpreting, solving, and expressing problems. In short, introduce Mathematics in relation to some problem, in the light of, or in context of something related to the field you study - which is CS in our case.\r\n\r\nGiven the above, and given the good intention of OSSU creators to advance humanity by making Computer Science learning accessible to a greater number of people who\'re willing to put their time and effort to become Computer Scientists, I claim that there is an opportunity for OSSU to fix a problem related to teaching mathematics in formal education, and hence make the curriculum accessible to a greater number of people, some of which can become good at CS and Math but discouraged by the mathematics - the problem of teaching math as a bunch of facts or techniques produced by some people (i.e. mathematicians) that the students ought to master - by introducing math lately in the curriculum. \r\n\r\n**How this proposed solution will contribute to fixing the math teaching problem in formal education ?**\r\n\r\nBy the time the learner finish ""Intro CS"" they would\'ve been introduced to some mathematical concepts but in a superficial way. They\'d also have an answer to the question: Is CS my field of interest or not. This is in fact the function of an Intro Course; to give the learner enough knowledge in order to decide if they would like to purse more or that what they\'ve known is enough.\r\n\r\nFrom the three courses in ""Intro cs"" -  CS50P, Python for Everybody, 6.0001 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python - 6.0001 is the only course that introduce mathematical concepts because it\'s the only course that introduces CS. The other two courses are programming and not CS courses. \r\n\r\nFor instance, in 6.0001 the first appearance of mathematical concept is in ""Lec-3"" the cubic root of some number and the ""guess and check method""; The second appearance in ""Lec-10,11"" in the form of graphs of the running time of algorithms - constant, linear, log, ...etc. None of these require a whole knowledge and mastering of High School Math; they just need a simple search on google to understand what it means by cubic root. In terms of the graphs, the function of graphs in Mathematics in general is to express some Mathematical ideas visually. So, by only looking to the graphs the learner could see what constant mean visually and so on, also something that doesn\'t require mastering High School Math.\r\n\r\nMIT, the university that is issuing the course is an engineering university. In fact the Bachelor Degree of Computer Science at MIT is a Degree in Computer Science and Engineering [^4]. Hence, MIT assumes that their freshman students should have High School knowledge not only of math but of physics also. This is one of the reasons of why MIT is known for its hard admission exams and the way they filter their freshmen students.\r\n\r\nEvery higher education institution has a way to filter students through entrance examinations - SAT, MCAT, ...etc. The reason that this is the case in higher education is because every college and university have a finite number of places for students - a situation which online MOOC education doesn\'t face - and the growth in higher education made an intense competition for seats [^5]. Therefore, filtering out students doesn\'t have any meaning in MOOC settings. In fact the opposite is true. MOOC is intended to everyone that is willing to invest their effort and time regardless of their background. Even if they didn\'t attend High School all together.\r\n\r\n6.0001 Course itself - Not MIT, The University - doesn\'t require High School math as a prerequisite [^6]. The text-book recommended by the course itself is a book by Professor John Guttag, in the preface of the book there is no mentions to any prerequisite. In fact Professor John said ""The book is aimed at 1) readers with little or no prior programming experience who have a desire to understand computational approaches to problem solving, and 2) more experienced programmers who want to learn how to use computation to model things or explore data."" This second target audience of the book ""The experienced programmers"" are required to know, in Prof. John words ""[what is required is] no knowledge of mathematics beyond high school algebra, but do assume that the reader is comfortable with rigorous thinking and is not intimidated by mathematical concepts."" This requirement is needed for ""experienced programmers"" taking a second course in computer science, which is 6.0002, a course not in OSSU curriculum, and is not an introductory course. Professor John\'s book contains the material for teaching 6.0001 & 6.0002 [^7].  MIT in another place recommended prerequisite for this course 6.0001, which is in their words ""No prior programming experience is necessary to take, understand, or be successful in 6.0001. Familiarity with pre-calculus, especially series, will be helpful for some topics, but is not required to understand the majority of the content. [^8]"" The keywords here is ""Some Topics"" and ""Is not required to understand the majority of the content"". Does this means that MIT recommended pre-calculus and hence High School math as prerequisite for 6.0001 ? Yes. Does this mean that their is no other way to learn 6.0001 than learning the entirety of High School math ? No, because MIT themselves put this phrase ""Is not required to understand the majority of the content"" for a reason, to say, don\'t get discouraged to take this course if you don\'t have pre-calculus and hence High School math because ""[its] not required to understand the majority of content"". Is it then necessary to not take 6.0001 course until finishing High School Mathematics ? My answer is no. You can take the course and google the two concepts that will meet you.\r\n\r\n\r\n**What can be modified in the current OSSU Curriculum ?**\r\n\r\nI propose to move Mathematics Prerequisite to later in the Curriculum, to either directly before Core Programming, or to Directly before Core Mathematics. None of the Core Programming courses in fact require any Mathematics as a prerequisite. And prerequisites on Courcera, and in every other online learning platform or course, has to be said explicitly. \r\n\r\nIn fact the reason to take High School mathematics is because it\'s a prerequisite for calculus. But than we must ask why we learn calculus in Computer Science, or at least why before Discrete Math ? Some would answer, because Calculus is a prerequisite for Discrete Math. This is what MIT recommended, but again, MIT is engineering university with an intense competition for the number of students allowed to study at MIT. \r\n\r\nThis whole organization of Mathematics Curriculum in USA, and by implication in most of the world is questionable. Arithmetic, then Geometry, then Pre-Algebra, then High School Math (Pre-calculus), then calculus and discrete mathematics, is not the only why to learn mathematics; most of the people can learn Mathematics to even Higher Mathematics (Graduate level Mathematics) starting from Discrete Math or what we call ""Math for Computer Science""[^9]. However, this argument is not the scope of this discussion. I just put it forward for the sake of showing that what we take for granted about learning math is not necessary the best way to learn it. this is not my personal opinion, this is the opinion of many great mathematician, for instance, George Pólya, and The Mathematician and Philosopher, Imre Lakatos ([^3] for more details).\r\n\r\n**Final Words**\r\n\r\nI\'ll Finish with a quote from the philosopher, educator, encyclopedist, and popular author Mortimer J. Adler that i think is directed to anyone who is responsible for providing education for people especially MOOC education. \r\n""We are on record as holding that unlimited education opportunity-or, specking practically, education opportunity that is limited only by individual desire, ability, and need- is the most valuable service that society can provide for its members. That we don\'t know how to provide that kind of opportunity is no reason to give up the attempt.[^10]."" \r\n\r\n---\r\n[^1]: [Summary section, At OSSU GitHub page.](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/tree/bc733da3f452524ee3566e15d33b140bc6b6571a).\r\n[^2]: [For instance, giving two approaches for learning Operating Systems in a great detail](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/bc733da3f452524ee3566e15d33b140bc6b6571a/coursepages/ostep/README.md).\r\n[^3]: Li, Y., Schoenfeld, A.H.

Rather, an expansion to the FAQ or a separate 'Note to students who are uncomfortable with mathematics' might be a better fit.\r\n\r\nI also recommend that. A notification to learners who are not confident at mathematics telling them that there are more than one path. You can for instance, delay Mathematics to after programing, the pros you'll be introduced to more programming to decide if Computer Science is your thing or not; the cons. is that you'll delay algorithms until you finish you Math, in that time you can study Mathematics and exercise your programming knowledge by doing some projects about things that interest you.\r\n\r\nIn the normal progression of OSSU you'll finish Core Programming then you'll start Core Mathematics. So, in either cases you'll stop programming to do Math. In the best case you'll take Math Courses concurrently with other CS Courses; however, this is the best case scenario not the norm.\r\n\r\nI think its best to explicitly inform the learners, as you recommended, that there is many ways you can do this Curriculum. From these many ways we know only two; path (a) and path (b). This is what we know from our experiences, and its up to you how you organize your study. In short, make the suggestion more flexible without being chaotic. \r\n\r\n"", 'reactions': {'url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/ossu/computer-science/issues/comments/2039510205/reactions', 'total_count': 0, '+1': 0, '-1': 0, 'laugh': 0, 'hooray': 0, 'confused': 0, 'heart': 0, 'rocket': 0, 'eyes': 0}, 'performed_via_github_app': None}}"

This means democratizing Computer Science education; make it accessible to everyone. Accessibility doesn\'t mean only providing the required material (i.e. courses) for free, but also providing the road-map and guidance on certain issues that the beginner learner doesn\'t have the experience to know or consider. And this is what OSSU is achieving by providing the courses, the road-map and the mentoring in the form of detailed guidance [^2]. \r\n\r\nComputer Science as a discipline is a branch of mathematics. Most universities around the world assume that students who aim at studying Computer Science have finished high school Mathematics. The way mathematics is taught in high school is not the best way to teach it. In fact, i don\'t think that anyone knows what is the best way to teach it. Nonetheless it remains a fact that many students who hate mathematics - because of a bad teacher, or the subject is presented in a way that doesn\'t reflect the true nature of Mathematics - are not in fact bad at Mathematics. This means that if the way Mathematics is presented in high schools changed, many\'ll find it an appealing and natural subject to learn [^3]; they\'ll become good at it. Changing the way Mathematics is presented in High Schools means introducing Mathematics when needed, not as a bunch of facts and techniques that the student should master; but as a tool for interpreting, solving, and expressing problems. In short, introduce Mathematics in relation to some problem, in the light of, or in context of something related to the field you study - which is CS in our case.\r\n\r\nGiven the above, and given the good intention of OSSU creators to advance humanity by making Computer Science learning accessible to a greater number of people who\'re willing to put their time and effort to become Computer Scientists, I claim that there is an opportunity for OSSU to fix a problem related to teaching mathematics in formal education, and hence make the curriculum accessible to a greater number of people, some of which can become good at CS and Math but discouraged by the mathematics - the problem of teaching math as a bunch of facts or techniques produced by some people (i.e. mathematicians) that the students ought to master - by introducing math lately in the curriculum. \r\n\r\n**How this proposed solution will contribute to fixing the math teaching problem in formal education ?**\r\n\r\nBy the time the learner finish ""Intro CS"" they would\'ve been introduced to some mathematical concepts but in a superficial way. They\'d also have an answer to the question: Is CS my field of interest or not. This is in fact the function of an Intro Course; to give the learner enough knowledge in order to decide if they would like to purse more or that what they\'ve known is enough.\r\n\r\nFrom the three courses in ""Intro cs"" -  CS50P, Python for Everybody, 6.0001 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python - 6.0001 is the only course that introduce mathematical concepts because it\'s the only course that introduces CS. The other two courses are programming and not CS courses. \r\n\r\nFor instance, in 6.0001 the first appearance of mathematical concept is in ""Lec-3"" the cubic root of some number and the ""guess and check method""; The second appearance in ""Lec-10,11"" in the form of graphs of the running time of algorithms - constant, linear, log, ...etc. None of these require a whole knowledge and mastering of High School Math; they just need a simple search on google to understand what it means by cubic root. In terms of the graphs, the function of graphs in Mathematics in general is to express some Mathematical ideas visually. So, by only looking to the graphs the learner could see what constant mean visually and so on, also something that doesn\'t require mastering High School Math.\r\n\r\nMIT, the university that is issuing the course is an engineering university. In fact the Bachelor Degree of Computer Science at MIT is a Degree in Computer Science and Engineering [^4]. Hence, MIT assumes that their freshman students should have High School knowledge not only of math but of physics also. This is one of the reasons of why MIT is known for its hard admission exams and the way they filter their freshmen students.\r\n\r\nEvery higher education institution has a way to filter students through entrance examinations - SAT, MCAT, ...etc. The reason that this is the case in higher education is because every college and university have a finite number of places for students - a situation which online MOOC education doesn\'t face - and the growth in higher education made an intense competition for seats [^5]. Therefore, filtering out students doesn\'t have any meaning in MOOC settings. In fact the opposite is true. MOOC is intended to everyone that is willing to invest their effort and time regardless of their background. Even if they didn\'t attend High School all together.\r\n\r\n6.0001 Course itself - Not MIT, The University - doesn\'t require High School math as a prerequisite [^6]. The text-book recommended by the course itself is a book by Professor John Guttag, in the preface of the book there is no mentions to any prerequisite. In fact Professor John said ""The book is aimed at 1) readers with little or no prior programming experience who have a desire to understand computational approaches to problem solving, and 2) more experienced programmers who want to learn how to use computation to model things or explore data."" This second target audience of the book ""The experienced programmers"" are required to know, in Prof. John words ""[what is required is] no knowledge of mathematics beyond high school algebra, but do assume that the reader is comfortable with rigorous thinking and is not intimidated by mathematical concepts."" This requirement is needed for ""experienced programmers"" taking a second course in computer science, which is 6.0002, a course not in OSSU curriculum, and is not an introductory course. Professor John\'s book contains the material for teaching 6.0001 & 6.0002 [^7].  MIT in another place recommended prerequisite for this course 6.0001, which is in their words ""No prior programming experience is necessary to take, understand, or be successful in 6.0001. Familiarity with pre-calculus, especially series, will be helpful for some topics, but is not required to understand the majority of the content. [^8]"" The keywords here is ""Some Topics"" and ""Is not required to understand the majority of the content"". Does this means that MIT recommended pre-calculus and hence High School math as prerequisite for 6.0001 ? Yes. Does this mean that their is no other way to learn 6.0001 than learning the entirety of High School math ? No, because MIT themselves put this phrase ""Is not required to understand the majority of the content"" for a reason, to say, don\'t get discouraged to take this course if you don\'t have pre-calculus and hence High School math because ""[its] not required to understand the majority of content"". Is it then necessary to not take 6.0001 course until finishing High School Mathematics ? My answer is no. You can take the course and google the two concepts that will meet you.\r\n\r\n\r\n**What can be modified in the current OSSU Curriculum ?**\r\n\r\nI propose to move Mathematics Prerequisite to later in the Curriculum, to either directly before Core Programming, or to Directly before Core Mathematics. None of the Core Programming courses in fact require any Mathematics as a prerequisite. And prerequisites on Courcera, and in every other online learning platform or course, has to be said explicitly. \r\n\r\nIn fact the reason to take High School mathematics is because it\'s a prerequisite for calculus. But than we must ask why we learn calculus in Computer Science, or at least why before Discrete Math ? Some would answer, because Calculus is a prerequisite for Discrete Math. This is what MIT recommended, but again, MIT is engineering university with an intense competition for the number of students allowed to study at MIT. \r\n\r\nThis whole organization of Mathematics Curriculum in USA, and by implication in most of the world is questionable. Arithmetic, then Geometry, then Pre-Algebra, then High School Math (Pre-calculus), then calculus and discrete mathematics, is not the only why to learn mathematics; most of the people can learn Mathematics to even Higher Mathematics (Graduate level Mathematics) starting from Discrete Math or what we call ""Math for Computer Science""[^9]. However, this argument is not the scope of this discussion. I just put it forward for the sake of showing that what we take for granted about learning math is not necessary the best way to learn it. this is not my personal opinion, this is the opinion of many great mathematician, for instance, George Pólya, and The Mathematician and Philosopher, Imre Lakatos ([^3] for more details).\r\n\r\n**Final Words**\r\n\r\nI\'ll Finish with a quote from the philosopher, educator, encyclopedist, and popular author Mortimer J. Adler that i think is directed to anyone who is responsible for providing education for people especially MOOC education. \r\n""We are on record as holding that unlimited education opportunity-or, specking practically, education opportunity that is limited only by individual desire, ability, and need- is the most valuable service that society can provide for its members. That we don\'t know how to provide that kind of opportunity is no reason to give up the attempt.[^10]."" \r\n\r\n---\r\n[^1]: [Summary section, At OSSU GitHub page.](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/tree/bc733da3f452524ee3566e15d33b140bc6b6571a).\r\n[^2]: [For instance, giving two approaches for learning Operating Systems in a great detail](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/bc733da3f452524ee3566e15d33b140bc6b6571a/coursepages/ostep/README.md).\r\n[^3]: Li, Y., Schoenfeld, A.H.

I think it safe to assume that MIT requires you to have a good understanding of high school algebra before you take the course.\r\n\r\nMIT recommended High School math as a prerequisite for this course in the link you provided of edx. But on the other link they didn\'t recommended. (https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/).  Don\'t forget that at MIT Computer Science degree means Computer Science and Electrical Engineering degree.\r\n\r\nIn another link of MIT they say. \r\n> Prerequisites: No prior programming experience is necessary to take, understand, or be successful in 6.0001. Familiarity with pre-calculus, especially series, will be helpful for some topics, but is not required to understand the majority of the content.\r\n\r\n""But is not required to understand the majority of the content"" its required to understand ""some topics"". They put this sentence for a reason. They want to say if you don\'t have a familiarity with Pre-calculus - which is trig & algebra - don\'t get discouraged because you\'ll understand ""the majority of content"". In fact anyone who took this course knows that you can master it without the need to master High School Math. (https://mitocw.ups.edu.ec/courses/intro-programming/).\r\n\r\nDoes this means that High School Math is unimportant ?\r\nNot at all. It just means you can delay it and take it after you\'ve finished this course or even later. The learner will learn a lot of math in Computer Science. My point is not to make Math an obstacle. Encourage the learner to love the discipline first, and then present them with all the math that\'s required. This is my whole point.\r\n\r\n', 'reactions': {'url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/ossu/computer-science/issues/comments/2039289740/reactions', 'total_count': 0, '+1': 0, '-1': 0, 'laugh': 0, 'hooray': 0, 'confused': 0, 'heart': 0, 'rocket': 0, 'eyes': 0}, 'performed_via_github_app': None}}"

This means democratizing Computer Science education; make it accessible to everyone. Accessibility doesn\'t mean only providing the required material (i.e. courses) for free, but also providing the road-map and guidance on certain issues that the beginner learner doesn\'t have the experience to know or consider. And this is what OSSU is achieving by providing the courses, the road-map and the mentoring in the form of detailed guidance [^2]. \r\n\r\nComputer Science as a discipline is a branch of mathematics. Most universities around the world assume that students who aim at studying Computer Science have finished high school Mathematics. The way mathematics is taught in high school is not the best way to teach it. In fact, i don\'t think that anyone knows what is the best way to teach it. Nonetheless it remains a fact that many students who hate mathematics - because of a bad teacher, or the subject is presented in a way that doesn\'t reflect the true nature of Mathematics - are not in fact bad at Mathematics. This means that if the way Mathematics is presented in high schools changed, many\'ll find it an appealing and natural subject to learn [^3]; they\'ll become good at it. Changing the way Mathematics is presented in High Schools means introducing Mathematics when needed, not as a bunch of facts and techniques that the student should master; but as a tool for interpreting, solving, and expressing problems. In short, introduce Mathematics in relation to some problem, in the light of, or in context of something related to the field you study - which is CS in our case.\r\n\r\nGiven the above, and given the good intention of OSSU creators to advance humanity by making Computer Science learning accessible to a greater number of people who\'re willing to put their time and effort to become Computer Scientists, I claim that there is an opportunity for OSSU to fix a problem related to teaching mathematics in formal education, and hence make the curriculum accessible to a greater number of people, some of which can become good at CS and Math but discouraged by the mathematics - the problem of teaching math as a bunch of facts or techniques produced by some people (i.e. mathematicians) that the students ought to master - by introducing math lately in the curriculum. \r\n\r\n**How this proposed solution will contribute to fixing the math teaching problem in formal education ?**\r\n\r\nBy the time the learner finish ""Intro CS"" they would\'ve been introduced to some mathematical concepts but in a superficial way. They\'d also have an answer to the question: Is CS my field of interest or not. This is in fact the function of an Intro Course; to give the learner enough knowledge in order to decide if they would like to purse more or that what they\'ve known is enough.\r\n\r\nFrom the three courses in ""Intro cs"" -  CS50P, Python for Everybody, 6.0001 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python - 6.0001 is the only course that introduce mathematical concepts because it\'s the only course that introduces CS. The other two courses are programming and not CS courses. \r\n\r\nFor instance, in 6.0001 the first appearance of mathematical concept is in ""Lec-3"" the cubic root of some number and the ""guess and check method""; The second appearance in ""Lec-10,11"" in the form of graphs of the running time of algorithms - constant, linear, log, ...etc. None of these require a whole knowledge and mastering of High School Math; they just need a simple search on google to understand what it means by cubic root. In terms of the graphs, the function of graphs in Mathematics in general is to express some Mathematical ideas visually. So, by only looking to the graphs the learner could see what constant mean visually and so on, also something that doesn\'t require mastering High School Math.\r\n\r\nMIT, the university that is issuing the course is an engineering university. In fact the Bachelor Degree of Computer Science at MIT is a Degree in Computer Science and Engineering [^4]. Hence, MIT assumes that their freshman students should have High School knowledge not only of math but of physics also. This is one of the reasons of why MIT is known for its hard admission exams and the way they filter their freshmen students.\r\n\r\nEvery higher education institution has a way to filter students through entrance examinations - SAT, MCAT, ...etc. The reason that this is the case in higher education is because every college and university have a finite number of places for students - a situation which online MOOC education doesn\'t face - and the growth in higher education made an intense competition for seats [^5]. Therefore, filtering out students doesn\'t have any meaning in MOOC settings. In fact the opposite is true. MOOC is intended to everyone that is willing to invest their effort and time regardless of their background. Even if they didn\'t attend High School all together.\r\n\r\n6.0001 Course itself - Not MIT, The University - doesn\'t require High School math as a prerequisite [^6]. The text-book recommended by the course itself is a book by Professor John Guttag, in the preface of the book there is no mentions to any prerequisite. In fact Professor John said ""The book is aimed at 1) readers with little or no prior programming experience who have a desire to understand computational approaches to problem solving, and 2) more experienced programmers who want to learn how to use computation to model things or explore data."" This second target audience of the book ""The experienced programmers"" are required to know, in Prof. John words ""[what is required is] no knowledge of mathematics beyond high school algebra, but do assume that the reader is comfortable with rigorous thinking and is not intimidated by mathematical concepts."" This requirement is needed for ""experienced programmers"" taking a second course in computer science, which is 6.0002, a course not in OSSU curriculum, and is not an introductory course. Professor John\'s book contains the material for teaching 6.0001 & 6.0002 [^7].  MIT in another place recommended prerequisite for this course 6.0001, which is in their words ""No prior programming experience is necessary to take, understand, or be successful in 6.0001. Familiarity with pre-calculus, especially series, will be helpful for some topics, but is not required to understand the majority of the content. [^8]"" The keywords here is ""Some Topics"" and ""Is not required to understand the majority of the content"". Does this means that MIT recommended pre-calculus and hence High School math as prerequisite for 6.0001 ? Yes. Does this mean that their is no other way to learn 6.0001 than learning the entirety of High School math ? No, because MIT themselves put this phrase ""Is not required to understand the majority of the content"" for a reason, to say, don\'t get discouraged to take this course if you don\'t have pre-calculus and hence High School math because ""[its] not required to understand the majority of content"". Is it then necessary to not take 6.0001 course until finishing High School Mathematics ? My answer is no. You can take the course and google the two concepts that will meet you.\r\n\r\n\r\n**What can be modified in the current OSSU Curriculum ?**\r\n\r\nI propose to move Mathematics Prerequisite to later in the Curriculum, to either directly before Core Programming, or to Directly before Core Mathematics. None of the Core Programming courses in fact require any Mathematics as a prerequisite. And prerequisites on Courcera, and in every other online learning platform or course, has to be said explicitly. \r\n\r\nIn fact the reason to take High School mathematics is because it\'s a prerequisite for calculus. But than we must ask why we learn calculus in Computer Science, or at least why before Discrete Math ? Some would answer, because Calculus is a prerequisite for Discrete Math. This is what MIT recommended, but again, MIT is engineering university with an intense competition for the number of students allowed to study at MIT. \r\n\r\nThis whole organization of Mathematics Curriculum in USA, and by implication in most of the world is questionable. Arithmetic, then Geometry, then Pre-Algebra, then High School Math (Pre-calculus), then calculus and discrete mathematics, is not the only why to learn mathematics; most of the people can learn Mathematics to even Higher Mathematics (Graduate level Mathematics) starting from Discrete Math or what we call ""Math for Computer Science""[^9]. However, this argument is not the scope of this discussion. I just put it forward for the sake of showing that what we take for granted about learning math is not necessary the best way to learn it. this is not my personal opinion, this is the opinion of many great mathematician, for instance, George Pólya, and The Mathematician and Philosopher, Imre Lakatos ([^3] for more details).\r\n\r\n**Final Words**\r\n\r\nI\'ll Finish with a quote from the philosopher, educator, encyclopedist, and popular author Mortimer J. Adler that i think is directed to anyone who is responsible for providing education for people especially MOOC education. \r\n""We are on record as holding that unlimited education opportunity-or, specking practically, education opportunity that is limited only by individual desire, ability, and need- is the most valuable service that society can provide for its members. That we don\'t know how to provide that kind of opportunity is no reason to give up the attempt.[^10]."" \r\n\r\n---\r\n[^1]: [Summary section, At OSSU GitHub page.](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/tree/bc733da3f452524ee3566e15d33b140bc6b6571a).\r\n[^2]: [For instance, giving two approaches for learning Operating Systems in a great detail](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/bc733da3f452524ee3566e15d33b140bc6b6571a/coursepages/ostep/README.md).\r\n[^3]: Li, Y., Schoenfeld, A.H.

I am writing to propose the addition of an Arabic translation to the OSSU Computer Science Curriculum. Currently, the curriculum is available in English, Chinese, and Brazilian Portuguese, and I am eager to contribute by creating an Arabic version.\n\n_**Issue Title: Adding Arabic Translation to OSSU Computer Science Curriculum**_\n\n_**Issue Body:**_\n\nI am enthusiastic about volunteering to translate the OSSU Computer Science Curriculum into Arabic. With over 400 million Arabic speakers worldwide, this translation has the potential to benefit a significant number of learners who prefer Arabic as their primary learning language.\n\nI am committed to actively participating in the translation process, ensuring that the content is not only accurately translated but also culturally relevant. This initiative aligns with the OSSU's goal of making quality education accessible to a global audience.\n\nPlease let me know if there are specific guidelines or requirements for translations, and if there are any existing resources or tools that I should use during the translation process.\n\nI look forward to contributing to this fantastic initiative and helping make the OSSU Computer Science Curriculum available to Arabic-speaking learners.\n\nThank you for considering my proposal.\n\nBest regards, Bassam Mejlaoui @mejbass "", 'reactions': {'url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/ossu/computer-science/issues/1214/reactions', 'total_count': 1, '+1': 0, '-1': 0, 'laugh': 0, 'hooray': 0, 'confused': 0, 'heart': 1, 'rocket': 0, 'eyes': 0}, 'timeline_url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/ossu/computer-science/issues/1214/timeline', 'performed_via_github_app': None, 'state_reason': None}, 'comment': {'url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/ossu/computer-science/issues/comments/2038930184', 'html_url': 'https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/1214#issuecomment-2038930184', 'issue_url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/ossu/computer-science/issues/1214', 'id': 2038930184, 'node_id': 'IC_kwDOAShAGM55h5sI', 'user': {'login': 'waciumawanjohi', 'id': 18407643, 'node_id': 'MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDA3NjQz', 'avatar_url': 'https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18407643?v=4', 'gravatar_id': '', 'url': 'https://api.github.com/users/waciumawanjohi', 'html_url': 'https://github.com/waciumawanjohi', 'followers_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/waciumawanjohi/followers', 'following_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/waciumawanjohi/following{/other_user}', 'gists_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/waciumawanjohi/gists{/gist_id}', 'starred_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/waciumawanjohi/starred{/owner}{/repo}', 'subscriptions_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/waciumawanjohi/subscriptions', 'organizations_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/waciumawanjohi/orgs', 'repos_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/waciumawanjohi/repos', 'events_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/waciumawanjohi/events{/privacy}', 'received_events_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/waciumawanjohi/received_events', 'type': 'User', 'site_admin': False}, 'created_at': '2024-04-05T04:54:25Z', 'updated_at': '2024-04-05T04:54:25Z', 'author_association': 'MEMBER', 'body': ""The curricular guide you have written is a fine introduction (or guide) to the proposed curriculum.

I am writing to propose the addition of an Arabic translation to the OSSU Computer Science Curriculum. Currently, the curriculum is available in English, Chinese, and Brazilian Portuguese, and I am eager to contribute by creating an Arabic version.\n\n_**Issue Title: Adding Arabic Translation to OSSU Computer Science Curriculum**_\n\n_**Issue Body:**_\n\nI am enthusiastic about volunteering to translate the OSSU Computer Science Curriculum into Arabic. With over 400 million Arabic speakers worldwide, this translation has the potential to benefit a significant number of learners who prefer Arabic as their primary learning language.\n\nI am committed to actively participating in the translation process, ensuring that the content is not only accurately translated but also culturally relevant. This initiative aligns with the OSSU's goal of making quality education accessible to a global audience.\n\nPlease let me know if there are specific guidelines or requirements for translations, and if there are any existing resources or tools that I should use during the translation process.\n\nI look forward to contributing to this fantastic initiative and helping make the OSSU Computer Science Curriculum available to Arabic-speaking learners.\n\nThank you for considering my proposal.\n\nBest regards, Bassam Mejlaoui @mejbass "", 'reactions': {'url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/ossu/computer-science/issues/1214/reactions', 'total_count': 1, '+1': 0, '-1': 0, 'laugh': 0, 'hooray': 0, 'confused': 0, 'heart': 1, 'rocket': 0, 'eyes': 0}, 'timeline_url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/ossu/computer-science/issues/1214/timeline', 'performed_via_github_app': None, 'state_reason': None}, 'comment': {'url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/ossu/computer-science/issues/comments/2038922427', 'html_url': 'https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/1214#issuecomment-2038922427', 'issue_url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/ossu/computer-science/issues/1214', 'id': 2038922427, 'node_id': 'IC_kwDOAShAGM55h3y7', 'user': {'login': 'waciumawanjohi', 'id': 18407643, 'node_id': 'MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDA3NjQz', 'avatar_url': 'https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18407643?v=4', 'gravatar_id': '', 'url': 'https://api.github.com/users/waciumawanjohi', 'html_url': 'https://github.com/waciumawanjohi', 'followers_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/waciumawanjohi/followers', 'following_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/waciumawanjohi/following{/other_user}', 'gists_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/waciumawanjohi/gists{/gist_id}', 'starred_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/waciumawanjohi/starred{/owner}{/repo}', 'subscriptions_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/waciumawanjohi/subscriptions', 'organizations_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/waciumawanjohi/orgs', 'repos_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/waciumawanjohi/repos', 'events_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/waciumawanjohi/events{/privacy}', 'received_events_url': 'https://api.github.com/users/waciumawanjohi/received_events', 'type': 'User', 'site_admin': False}, 'created_at': '2024-04-05T04:49:29Z', 'updated_at': '2024-04-05T04:49:29Z', 'author_association': 'MEMBER', 'body': 'The contribution guideline looks good.

This means democratizing Computer Science education; make it accessible to everyone. Accessibility doesn\'t mean only providing the required material (i.e. courses) for free, but also providing the road-map and guidance on certain issues that the beginner learner doesn\'t have the experience to know or consider. And this is what OSSU is achieving by providing the courses, the road-map and the mentoring in the form of detailed guidance [^2]. \r\n\r\nComputer Science as a discipline is a branch of mathematics. Most universities around the world assume that students who aim at studying Computer Science have finished high school Mathematics. The way mathematics is taught in high school is not the best way to teach it. In fact, i don\'t think that anyone knows what is the best way to teach it. Nonetheless it remains a fact that many students who hate mathematics - because of a bad teacher, or the subject is presented in a way that doesn\'t reflect the true nature of Mathematics - are not in fact bad at Mathematics. This means that if the way Mathematics is presented in high schools changed, many\'ll find it an appealing and natural subject to learn [^3]; they\'ll become good at it. Changing the way Mathematics is presented in High Schools means introducing Mathematics when needed, not as a bunch of facts and techniques that the student should master; but as a tool for interpreting, solving, and expressing problems. In short, introduce Mathematics in relation to some problem, in the light of, or in context of something related to the field you study - which is CS in our case.\r\n\r\nGiven the above, and given the good intention of OSSU creators to advance humanity by making Computer Science learning accessible to a greater number of people who\'re willing to put their time and effort to become Computer Scientists, I claim that there is an opportunity for OSSU to fix a problem related to teaching mathematics in formal education, and hence make the curriculum accessible to a greater number of people, some of which can become good at CS and Math but discouraged by the mathematics - the problem of teaching math as a bunch of facts or techniques produced by some people (i.e. mathematicians) that the students ought to master - by introducing math lately in the curriculum. \r\n\r\n**How this proposed solution will contribute to fixing the math teaching problem in formal education ?**\r\n\r\nBy the time the learner finish ""Intro CS"" they would\'ve been introduced to some mathematical concepts but in a superficial way. They\'d also have an answer to the question: Is CS my field of interest or not. This is in fact the function of an Intro Course; to give the learner enough knowledge in order to decide if they would like to purse more or that what they\'ve known is enough.\r\n\r\nFrom the three courses in ""Intro cs"" -  CS50P, Python for Everybody, 6.0001 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python - 6.0001 is the only course that introduce mathematical concepts because it\'s the only course that introduces CS. The other two courses are programming and not CS courses. \r\n\r\nFor instance, in 6.0001 the first appearance of mathematical concept is in ""Lec-3"" the cubic root of some number and the ""guess and check method""; The second appearance in ""Lec-10,11"" in the form of graphs of the running time of algorithms - constant, linear, log, ...etc. None of these require a whole knowledge and mastering of High School Math; they just need a simple search on google to understand what it means by cubic root. In terms of the graphs, the function of graphs in Mathematics in general is to express some Mathematical ideas visually. So, by only looking to the graphs the learner could see what constant mean visually and so on, also something that doesn\'t require mastering High School Math.\r\n\r\nMIT, the university that is issuing the course is an engineering university. In fact the Bachelor Degree of Computer Science at MIT is a Degree in Computer Science and Engineering [^4]. Hence, MIT assumes that their freshman students should have High School knowledge not only of math but of physics also. This is one of the reasons of why MIT is known for its hard admission exams and the way they filter their freshmen students.\r\n\r\nEvery higher education institution has a way to filter students through entrance examinations - SAT, MCAT, ...etc. The reason that this is the case in higher education is because every college and university have a finite number of places for students - a situation which online MOOC education doesn\'t face - and the growth in higher education made an intense competition for seats [^5]. Therefore, filtering out students doesn\'t have any meaning in MOOC settings. In fact the opposite is true. MOOC is intended to everyone that is willing to invest their effort and time regardless of their background. Even if they didn\'t attend High School all together.\r\n\r\n6.0001 Course itself - Not MIT, The University - doesn\'t require High School math as a prerequisite [^6]. The text-book recommended by the course itself is a book by Professor John Guttag, in the preface of the book there is no mentions to any prerequisite. In fact Professor John said ""The book is aimed at 1) readers with little or no prior programming experience who have a desire to understand computational approaches to problem solving, and 2) more experienced programmers who want to learn how to use computation to model things or explore data."" This second target audience of the book ""The experienced programmers"" are required to know, in Prof. John words ""[what is required is] no knowledge of mathematics beyond high school algebra, but do assume that the reader is comfortable with rigorous thinking and is not intimidated by mathematical concepts."" This requirement is needed for ""experienced programmers"" taking a second course in computer science, which is 6.0002, a course not in OSSU curriculum, and is not an introductory course. Professor John\'s book contains the material for teaching 6.0001 & 6.0002 [^7].  MIT in another place recommended prerequisite for this course 6.0001, which is in their words ""No prior programming experience is necessary to take, understand, or be successful in 6.0001. Familiarity with pre-calculus, especially series, will be helpful for some topics, but is not required to understand the majority of the content. [^8]"" The keywords here is ""Some Topics"" and ""Is not required to understand the majority of the content"". Does this means that MIT recommended pre-calculus and hence High School math as prerequisite for 6.0001 ? Yes. Does this mean that their is no other way to learn 6.0001 than learning the entirety of High School math ? No, because MIT themselves put this phrase ""Is not required to understand the majority of the content"" for a reason, to say, don\'t get discouraged to take this course if you don\'t have pre-calculus and hence High School math because ""[its] not required to understand the majority of content"". Is it then necessary to not take 6.0001 course until finishing High School Mathematics ? My answer is no. You can take the course and google the two concepts that will meet you.\r\n\r\n\r\n**What can be modified in the current OSSU Curriculum ?**\r\n\r\nI propose to move Mathematics Prerequisite to later in the Curriculum, to either directly before Core Programming, or to Directly before Core Mathematics. None of the Core Programming courses in fact require any Mathematics as a prerequisite. And prerequisites on Courcera, and in every other online learning platform or course, has to be said explicitly. \r\n\r\nIn fact the reason to take High School mathematics is because it\'s a prerequisite for calculus. But than we must ask why we learn calculus in Computer Science, or at least why before Discrete Math ? Some would answer, because Calculus is a prerequisite for Discrete Math. This is what MIT recommended, but again, MIT is engineering university with an intense competition for the number of students allowed to study at MIT. \r\n\r\nThis whole organization of Mathematics Curriculum in USA, and by implication in most of the world is questionable. Arithmetic, then Geometry, then Pre-Algebra, then High School Math (Pre-calculus), then calculus and discrete mathematics, is not the only why to learn mathematics; most of the people can learn Mathematics to even Higher Mathematics (Graduate level Mathematics) starting from Discrete Math or what we call ""Math for Computer Science""[^9]. However, this argument is not the scope of this discussion. I just put it forward for the sake of showing that what we take for granted about learning math is not necessary the best way to learn it. this is not my personal opinion, this is the opinion of many great mathematician, for instance, George Pólya, and The Mathematician and Philosopher, Imre Lakatos ([^3] for more details).\r\n\r\n**Final Words**\r\n\r\nI\'ll Finish with a quote from the philosopher, educator, encyclopedist, and popular author Mortimer J. Adler that i think is directed to anyone who is responsible for providing education for people especially MOOC education. \r\n""We are on record as holding that unlimited education opportunity-or, specking practically, education opportunity that is limited only by individual desire, ability, and need- is the most valuable service that society can provide for its members. That we don\'t know how to provide that kind of opportunity is no reason to give up the attempt.[^10]."" \r\n\r\n---\r\n[^1]: [Summary section, At OSSU GitHub page.](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/tree/bc733da3f452524ee3566e15d33b140bc6b6571a).\r\n[^2]: [For instance, giving two approaches for learning Operating Systems in a great detail](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/bc733da3f452524ee3566e15d33b140bc6b6571a/coursepages/ostep/README.md).\r\n[^3]: Li, Y., Schoenfeld, A.H.

This means democratizing Computer Science education; make it accessible to everyone. Accessibility doesn\'t mean only providing the required material (i.e. courses) for free, but also providing the road-map and guidance on certain issues that the beginner learner doesn\'t have the experience to know or consider. And this is what OSSU is achieving by providing the courses, the road-map and the mentoring in the form of detailed guidance [^2]. \r\n\r\nComputer Science as a discipline is a branch of mathematics. Most universities around the world assume that students who aim at studying Computer Science have finished high school Mathematics. The way mathematics is taught in high school is not the best way to teach it. In fact, i don\'t think that anyone knows what is the best way to teach it. Nonetheless it remains a fact that many students who hate mathematics - because of a bad teacher, or the subject is presented in a way that doesn\'t reflect the true nature of Mathematics - are not in fact bad at Mathematics. This means that if the way Mathematics is presented in high schools changed, many\'ll find it an appealing and natural subject to learn [^3]; they\'ll become good at it. Changing the way Mathematics is presented in High Schools means introducing Mathematics when needed, not as a bunch of facts and techniques that the student should master; but as a tool for interpreting, solving, and expressing problems. In short, introduce Mathematics in relation to some problem, in the light of, or in context of something related to the field you study - which is CS in our case.\r\n\r\nGiven the above, and given the good intention of OSSU creators to advance humanity by making Computer Science learning accessible to a greater number of people who\'re willing to put their time and effort to become Computer Scientists, I claim that there is an opportunity for OSSU to fix a problem related to teaching mathematics in formal education, and hence make the curriculum accessible to a greater number of people, some of which can become good at CS and Math but discouraged by the mathematics - the problem of teaching math as a bunch of facts or techniques produced by some people (i.e. mathematicians) that the students ought to master - by introducing math lately in the curriculum. \r\n\r\n**How this proposed solution will contribute to fixing the math teaching problem in formal education ?**\r\n\r\nBy the time the learner finish ""Intro CS"" they would\'ve been introduced to some mathematical concepts but in a superficial way. They\'d also have an answer to the question: Is CS my field of interest or not. This is in fact the function of an Intro Course; to give the learner enough knowledge in order to decide if they would like to purse more or that what they\'ve known is enough.\r\n\r\nFrom the three courses in ""Intro cs"" -  CS50P, Python for Everybody, 6.0001 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python - 6.0001 is the only course that introduce mathematical concepts because it\'s the only course that introduces CS. The other two courses are programming and not CS courses. \r\n\r\nFor instance, in 6.0001 the first appearance of mathematical concept is in ""Lec-3"" the cubic root of some number and the ""guess and check method""; The second appearance in ""Lec-10,11"" in the form of graphs of the running time of algorithms - constant, linear, log, ...etc. None of these require a whole knowledge and mastering of High School Math; they just need a simple search on google to understand what it means by cubic root. In terms of the graphs, the function of graphs in Mathematics in general is to express some Mathematical ideas visually. So, by only looking to the graphs the learner could see what constant mean visually and so on, also something that doesn\'t require mastering High School Math.\r\n\r\nMIT, the university that is issuing the course is an engineering university. In fact the Bachelor Degree of Computer Science at MIT is a Degree in Computer Science and Engineering [^4]. Hence, MIT assumes that their freshman students should have High School knowledge not only of math but of physics also. This is one of the reasons of why MIT is known for its hard admission exams and the way they filter their freshmen students.\r\n\r\nEvery higher education institution has a way to filter students through entrance examinations - SAT, MCAT, ...etc. The reason that this is the case in higher education is because every college and university have a finite number of places for students - a situation which online MOOC education doesn\'t face - and the growth in higher education made an intense competition for seats [^5]. Therefore, filtering out students doesn\'t have any meaning in MOOC settings. In fact the opposite is true. MOOC is intended to everyone that is willing to invest their effort and time regardless of their background. Even if they didn\'t attend High School all together.\r\n\r\n6.0001 Course itself - Not MIT, The University - doesn\'t require High School math as a prerequisite [^6]. The text-book recommended by the course itself is a book by Professor John Guttag, in the preface of the book there is no mentions to any prerequisite. In fact Professor John said ""The book is aimed at 1) readers with little or no prior programming experience who have a desire to understand computational approaches to problem solving, and 2) more experienced programmers who want to learn how to use computation to model things or explore data."" This second target audience of the book ""The experienced programmers"" are required to know, in Prof. John words ""[what is required is] no knowledge of mathematics beyond high school algebra, but do assume that the reader is comfortable with rigorous thinking and is not intimidated by mathematical concepts."" This requirement is needed for ""experienced programmers"" taking a second course in computer science, which is 6.0002, a course not in OSSU curriculum, and is not an introductory course. Professor John\'s book contains the material for teaching 6.0001 & 6.0002 [^7].  MIT in another place recommended prerequisite for this course 6.0001, which is in their words ""No prior programming experience is necessary to take, understand, or be successful in 6.0001. Familiarity with pre-calculus, especially series, will be helpful for some topics, but is not required to understand the majority of the content. [^8]"" The keywords here is ""Some Topics"" and ""Is not required to understand the majority of the content"". Does this means that MIT recommended pre-calculus and hence High School math as prerequisite for 6.0001 ? Yes. Does this mean that their is no other way to learn 6.0001 than learning the entirety of High School math ? No, because MIT themselves put this phrase ""Is not required to understand the majority of the content"" for a reason, to say, don\'t get discouraged to take this course if you don\'t have pre-calculus and hence High School math because ""[its] not required to understand the majority of content"". Is it then necessary to not take 6.0001 course until finishing High School Mathematics ? My answer is no. You can take the course and google the two concepts that will meet you.\r\n\r\n\r\n**What can be modified in the current OSSU Curriculum ?**\r\n\r\nI propose to move Mathematics Prerequisite to later in the Curriculum, to either directly before Core Programming, or to Directly before Core Mathematics. None of the Core Programming courses in fact require any Mathematics as a prerequisite. And prerequisites on Courcera, and in every other online learning platform or course, has to be said explicitly. \r\n\r\nIn fact the reason to take High School mathematics is because it\'s a prerequisite for calculus. But than we must ask why we learn calculus in Computer Science, or at least why before Discrete Math ? Some would answer, because Calculus is a prerequisite for Discrete Math. This is what MIT recommended, but again, MIT is engineering university with an intense competition for the number of students allowed to study at MIT. \r\n\r\nThis whole organization of Mathematics Curriculum in USA, and by implication in most of the world is questionable. Arithmetic, then Geometry, then Pre-Algebra, then High School Math (Pre-calculus), then calculus and discrete mathematics, is not the only why to learn mathematics; most of the people can learn Mathematics to even Higher Mathematics (Graduate level Mathematics) starting from Discrete Math or what we call ""Math for Computer Science""[^9]. However, this argument is not the scope of this discussion. I just put it forward for the sake of showing that what we take for granted about learning math is not necessary the best way to learn it. this is not my personal opinion, this is the opinion of many great mathematician, for instance, George Pólya, and The Mathematician and Philosopher, Imre Lakatos ([^3] for more details).\r\n\r\n**Final Words**\r\n\r\nI\'ll Finish with a quote from the philosopher, educator, encyclopedist, and popular author Mortimer J. Adler that i think is directed to anyone who is responsible for providing education for people especially MOOC education. \r\n""We are on record as holding that unlimited education opportunity-or, specking practically, education opportunity that is limited only by individual desire, ability, and need- is the most valuable service that society can provide for its members. That we don\'t know how to provide that kind of opportunity is no reason to give up the attempt.[^10]."" \r\n\r\n---\r\n[^1]: [Summary section, At OSSU GitHub page.](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/tree/bc733da3f452524ee3566e15d33b140bc6b6571a).\r\n[^2]: [For instance, giving two approaches for learning Operating Systems in a great detail](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/bc733da3f452524ee3566e15d33b140bc6b6571a/coursepages/ostep/README.md).\r\n[^3]: Li, Y., Schoenfeld, A.H.

This means democratizing Computer Science education; make it accessible to everyone. Accessibility doesn\'t mean only providing the required material (i.e. courses) for free, but also providing the road-map and guidance on certain issues that the beginner learner doesn\'t have the experience to know or consider. And this is what OSSU is achieving by providing the courses, the road-map and the mentoring in the form of detailed guidance [^2]. \r\n\r\nComputer Science as a discipline is a branch of mathematics. Most universities around the world assume that students who aim at studying Computer Science have finished high school Mathematics. The way mathematics is taught in high school is not the best way to teach it. In fact, i don\'t think that anyone knows what is the best way to teach it. Nonetheless it remains a fact that many students who hate mathematics - because of a bad teacher, or the subject is presented in a way that doesn\'t reflect the true nature of Mathematics - are not in fact bad at Mathematics. This means that if the way Mathematics is presented in high schools changed, many\'ll find it an appealing and natural subject to learn [^3]; they\'ll become good at it. Changing the way Mathematics is presented in High Schools means introducing Mathematics when needed, not as a bunch of facts and techniques that the student should master; but as a tool for interpreting, solving, and expressing problems. In short, introduce Mathematics in relation to some problem, in the light of, or in context of something related to the field you study - which is CS in our case.\r\n\r\nGiven the above, and given the good intention of OSSU creators to advance humanity by making Computer Science learning accessible to a greater number of people who\'re willing to put their time and effort to become Computer Scientists, I claim that there is an opportunity for OSSU to fix a problem related to teaching mathematics in formal education, and hence make the curriculum accessible to a greater number of people, some of which can become good at CS and Math but discouraged by the mathematics - the problem of teaching math as a bunch of facts or techniques produced by some people (i.e. mathematicians) that the students ought to master - by introducing math lately in the curriculum. \r\n\r\n**How this proposed solution will contribute to fixing the math teaching problem in formal education ?**\r\n\r\nBy the time the learner finish ""Intro CS"" they would\'ve been introduced to some mathematical concepts but in a superficial way. They\'d also have an answer to the question: Is CS my field of interest or not. This is in fact the function of an Intro Course; to give the learner enough knowledge in order to decide if they would like to purse more or that what they\'ve known is enough.\r\n\r\nFrom the three courses in ""Intro cs"" -  CS50P, Python for Everybody, 6.0001 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python - 6.0001 is the only course that introduce mathematical concepts because it\'s the only course that introduces CS. The other two courses are programming and not CS courses. \r\n\r\nFor instance, in 6.0001 the first appearance of mathematical concept is in ""Lec-3"" the cubic root of some number and the ""guess and check method""; The second appearance in ""Lec-10,11"" in the form of graphs of the running time of algorithms - constant, linear, log, ...etc. None of these require a whole knowledge and mastering of High School Math; they just need a simple search on google to understand what it means by cubic root. In terms of the graphs, the function of graphs in Mathematics in general is to express some Mathematical ideas visually. So, by only looking to the graphs the learner could see what constant mean visually and so on, also something that doesn\'t require mastering High School Math.\r\n\r\nMIT, the university that is issuing the course is an engineering university. In fact the Bachelor Degree of Computer Science at MIT is a Degree in Computer Science and Engineering [^4]. Hence, MIT assumes that their freshman students should have High School knowledge not only of math but of physics also. This is one of the reasons of why MIT is known for its hard admission exams and the way they filter their freshmen students.\r\n\r\nEvery higher education institution has a way to filter students through entrance examinations - SAT, MCAT, ...etc. The reason that this is the case in higher education is because every college and university have a finite number of places for students - a situation which online MOOC education doesn\'t face - and the growth in higher education made an intense competition for seats [^5]. Therefore, filtering out students doesn\'t have any meaning in MOOC settings. In fact the opposite is true. MOOC is intended to everyone that is willing to invest their effort and time regardless of their background. Even if they didn\'t attend High School all together.\r\n\r\n6.0001 Course itself - Not MIT, The University - doesn\'t require High School math as a prerequisite [^6]. The text-book recommended by the course itself is a book by Professor John Guttag, in the preface of the book there is no mentions to any prerequisite. In fact Professor John said ""The book is aimed at 1) readers with little or no prior programming experience who have a desire to understand computational approaches to problem solving, and 2) more experienced programmers who want to learn how to use computation to model things or explore data."" This second target audience of the book ""The experienced programmers"" are required to know, in Prof. John words ""[what is required is] no knowledge of mathematics beyond high school algebra, but do assume that the reader is comfortable with rigorous thinking and is not intimidated by mathematical concepts."" This requirement is needed for ""experienced programmers"" taking a second course in computer science, which is 6.0002, a course not in OSSU curriculum, and is not an introductory course. Professor John\'s book contains the material for teaching 6.0001 & 6.0002 [^7].  MIT in another place recommended prerequisite for this course 6.0001, which is in their words ""No prior programming experience is necessary to take, understand, or be successful in 6.0001. Familiarity with pre-calculus, especially series, will be helpful for some topics, but is not required to understand the majority of the content. [^8]"" The keywords here is ""Some Topics"" and ""Is not required to understand the majority of the content"". Does this means that MIT recommended pre-calculus and hence High School math as prerequisite for 6.0001 ? Yes. Does this mean that their is no other way to learn 6.0001 than learning the entirety of High School math ? No, because MIT themselves put this phrase ""Is not required to understand the majority of the content"" for a reason, to say, don\'t get discouraged to take this course if you don\'t have pre-calculus and hence High School math because ""[its] not required to understand the majority of content"". Is it then necessary to not take 6.0001 course until finishing High School Mathematics ? My answer is no. You can take the course and google the two concepts that will meet you.\r\n\r\n\r\n**What can be modified in the current OSSU Curriculum ?**\r\n\r\nI propose to move Mathematics Prerequisite to later in the Curriculum, to either directly before Core Programming, or to Directly before Core Mathematics. None of the Core Programming courses in fact require any Mathematics as a prerequisite. And prerequisites on Courcera, and in every other online learning platform or course, has to be said explicitly. \r\n\r\nIn fact the reason to take High School mathematics is because it\'s a prerequisite for calculus. But than we must ask why we learn calculus in Computer Science, or at least why before Discrete Math ? Some would answer, because Calculus is a prerequisite for Discrete Math. This is what MIT recommended, but again, MIT is engineering university with an intense competition for the number of students allowed to study at MIT. \r\n\r\nThis whole organization of Mathematics Curriculum in USA, and by implication in most of the world is questionable. Arithmetic, then Geometry, then Pre-Algebra, then High School Math (Pre-calculus), then calculus and discrete mathematics, is not the only why to learn mathematics; most of the people can learn Mathematics to even Higher Mathematics (Graduate level Mathematics) starting from Discrete Math or what we call ""Math for Computer Science""[^9]. However, this argument is not the scope of this discussion.

This means democratizing Computer Science education; make it accessible to everyone. Accessibility doesn\'t mean only providing the required material (i.e. courses) for free, but also providing the road-map and guidance on certain issues that the beginner learner doesn\'t have the experience to know or consider. And this is what OSSU is achieving by providing the courses, the road-map and the mentoring in the form of detailed guidance [^2]. \r\n\r\nComputer Science as a discipline is a branch of mathematics. Most universities around the world assume that students who aim at studying Computer Science have finished high school Mathematics. The way mathematics is taught in high school is not the best way to teach it. In fact, i don\'t think that anyone knows what is the best way to teach it. Nonetheless it remains a fact that many students who hate mathematics - because of a bad teacher, or the subject is presented in a way that doesn\'t reflect the true nature of Mathematics - are not in fact bad at Mathematics. This means that if the way Mathematics is presented in high schools changed, many\'ll find it an appealing and natural subject to learn [^3]; they\'ll become good at it. Changing the way Mathematics is presented in High Schools means introducing Mathematics when needed, not as a bunch of facts and techniques that the student should master; but as a tool for interpreting, solving, and expressing problems. In short, introduce Mathematics in relation to some problem, in the light of, or in context of something related to the field you study - which is CS in our case.\r\n\r\nGiven the above, and given the good intention of OSSU creators to advance humanity by making Computer Science learning accessible to a greater number of people who\'re willing to put their time and effort to become Computer Scientists, I claim that there is an opportunity for OSSU to fix a problem related to teaching mathematics in formal education, and hence make the curriculum accessible to a greater number of people, some of which can become good at CS and Math but discouraged by the mathematics - the problem of teaching math as a bunch of facts or techniques produced by some people (i.e. mathematicians) that the students ought to master - by introducing math lately in the curriculum. \r\n\r\n**How this proposed solution will contribute to fixing the math teaching problem in formal education ?**\r\n\r\nBy the time the learner finish ""Intro CS"" they would\'ve been introduced to some mathematical concepts but in a superficial way. They\'d also have an answer to the question: Is CS my field of interest or not. This is in fact the function of an Intro Course; to give the learner enough knowledge in order to decide if they would like to purse more or that what they\'ve known is enough.\r\n\r\nFrom the three courses in ""Intro cs"" -  CS50P, Python for Everybody, 6.0001 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python - 6.0001 is the only course that introduce mathematical concepts because it\'s the only course that introduces CS. The other two courses are programming and not CS courses. \r\n\r\nFor instance, in 6.0001 the first appearance of mathematical concept is in ""Lec-3"" the cubic root of some number and the ""guess and check method""; The second appearance in ""Lec-10,11"" in the form of graphs of the running time of algorithms - constant, linear, log, ...etc. None of these require a whole knowledge and mastering of High School Math; they just need a simple search on google to understand what it means by cubic root. In terms of the graphs, the function of graphs in Mathematics in general is to express some Mathematical ideas visually. So, by only looking to the graphs the learner could see what constant mean visually and so on, also something that doesn\'t require mastering High School Math.\r\n\r\nMIT, the university that is issuing the course is an engineering university. In fact the Bachelor Degree of Computer Science at MIT is a Degree in Computer Science and Engineering [^4]. Hence, MIT assumes that their freshman students should have High School knowledge not only of math but of physics also. This is one of the reasons of why MIT is known for its hard admission exams and the way they filter their freshmen students.\r\n\r\nEvery higher education institution has a way to filter students through entrance examinations - SAT, MCAT, ...etc. The reason that this is the case in higher education is because every college and university have a finite number of places for students - a situation which online MOOC education doesn\'t face - and the growth in higher education made an intense competition for seats [^5]. Therefore, filtering out students doesn\'t have any meaning in MOOC settings. In fact the opposite is true. MOOC is intended to everyone that is willing to invest their effort and time regardless of their background. Even if they didn\'t attend High School all together.\r\n\r\n6.0001 Course itself - Not MIT, The University - doesn\'t require High School math as a prerequisite [^6]. The text-book recommended by the course itself is a book by Professor John Guttag, in the preface of the book there is no mentions to any prerequisite. In fact Professor John said ""The book is aimed at 1) readers with little or no prior programming experience who have a desire to understand computational approaches to problem solving, and 2) more experienced programmers who want to learn how to use computation to model things or explore data."" This second target audience of the book ""The experienced programmers"" are required to know, in Prof. John words ""[what is required is] no knowledge of mathematics beyond high school algebra, but do assume that the reader is comfortable with rigorous thinking and is not intimidated by mathematical concepts."" This requirement is needed for ""experienced programmers"" taking a second course in computer science, which is 6.0002, a course not in OSSU curriculum, and is not an introductory course. Professor John\'s book contains the material for teaching 6.0001 & 6.0002 [^7].  MIT in another place recommended prerequisite for this course 6.0001, which is in their words ""No prior programming experience is necessary to take, understand, or be successful in 6.0001. Familiarity with pre-calculus, especially series, will be helpful for some topics, but is not required to understand the majority of the content. [^8]"" The keywords here is ""Some Topics"" and ""Is not required to understand the majority of the content"". Does this means that MIT recommended pre-calculus and hence High School math as prerequisite for 6.0001 ? Yes. Does this mean that their is no other way to learn 6.0001 than learning the entirety of High School math ? No, because MIT themselves put this phrase ""Is not required to understand the majority of the content"" for a reason, to say, don\'t get discouraged to take this course if you don\'t have pre-calculus and hence High School math because ""[its] not required to understand the majority of content"". Is it then necessary to not take 6.0001 course until finishing High School Mathematics ? My answer is no. You can take the course and google the two concepts that will meet you.\r\n\r\n\r\n**What can be modified in the current OSSU Curriculum ?**\r\n\r\nI propose to move Mathematics Prerequisite to later in the Curriculum, to either directly before Core Programming, or to Directly before Core Mathematics. None of the Core Programming courses in fact require any Mathematics as a prerequisite. And prerequisites on Courcera, and in every other online learning platform or course, has to be said explicitly. \r\n\r\nIn fact the reason to take High School mathematics is because it\'s a prerequisite for calculus. But than we must ask why we learn calculus in Computer Science, or at least why before Discrete Math ? Some would answer, because Calculus is a prerequisite for Discrete Math. This is what MIT recommended, but again, MIT is engineering university with an intense competition for the number of students allowed to study at MIT. \r\n\r\nThis whole organization of Mathematics Curriculum in USA, and by implication in most of the world is questionable. Arithmetic, then Geometry, then Pre-Algebra, then High School Math (Pre-calculus), then calculus and discrete mathematics, is not the only why to learn mathematics; most of the people can learn Mathematics to even Higher Mathematics (Graduate level Mathematics) starting from Discrete Math or what we call ""Math for Computer Science""[^9]. However, this argument is not the scope of this discussion. I just put it forward for the sake of showing that what we take for granted about learning math is not necessary the best way to learn it. this is not my personal opinion, this is the opinion of many great mathematician, for instance, George Pólya, and The Mathematician and Philosopher, Imre Lakatos ([^3] for more details).\r\n\r\n**Final Words**\r\n\r\nI\'ll Finish with a quote from the philosopher, educator, encyclopedist, and popular author Mortimer J. Adler that i think is directed to anyone who is responsible for providing education for people especially MOOC education. \r\n""We are on record as holding that unlimited education opportunity-or, specking practically, education opportunity that is limited only by individual desire, ability, and need- is the most valuable service that society can provide for its members. That we don\'t know how to provide that kind of opportunity is no reason to give up the attempt.[^10]."" \r\n\r\n---\r\n[^1]: [Summary section, At OSSU GitHub page.](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/tree/bc733da3f452524ee3566e15d33b140bc6b6571a).\r\n[^2]: [For instance, giving two approaches for learning Operating Systems in a great detail](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/bc733da3f452524ee3566e15d33b140bc6b6571a/coursepages/ostep/README.md).\r\n[^3]: Li, Y., Schoenfeld, A.H.
