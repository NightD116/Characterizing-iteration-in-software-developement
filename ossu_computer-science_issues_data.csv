4,2024-03-19T12:23:54Z,https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/pull/1224,Add Intro CS coursepage and replace the OCW version with an archived version on Edx,"Similar to #1176, a discord community member (satoshiriraagus) found an archived version of the MIT Intro CS course on Edx: https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:MITx+6.00.1x+2T2018/home

The OCW version is showing its age, and several problems are appearing with its content. IMO, the Edx version is much better, as it is newer (though it still uses python 3.5), it has much more finger exercises than the Edx version, and the biggest benefit: it has autograders which evaluate your code, unlike the OCW version.

Now, since the Edx version runs only three times a year and is instructor paced, it is not really suitable to be included as the default recommendation. That is where the archived Edx version comes. It is archived, so all the contents are available at once. It has no deadlines and is completely self-paced. So all in all, it has all the benefits of the Edx version, and none of its issues.

6,2024-03-09T14:31:19Z,https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/1222,RFC: A better theme for the OSSU CS website,"**Problem:**

* OSSU CS website (https://cs.ossu.dev) currently uses a very simple light theme.

**Duration:**
1 week?

**Background:**
OSSU CS website (https://cs.ossu.dev) currently uses a very simple light theme. While it is good enough, it can be better. It is very easy to add an official github-pages theme, and it requires only 2 lines to be added to this repo. I have, after discussion with people in the discord server, created a demo with a better, dark theme. It can be seen here: https://pulkitkrishna.eu.org/computer-science.

Adding the theme provides the following benefits:

- A better looking website (IMO. I know it is a subjective thing).
- Improves accessibility of the website.
- Provides a big ""View on GitHub"" button on top, inviting people to look at the repo, where the RFCs are.
- Improves the syntax highlighting of code, making it more readable (for example on https://cs.ossu.dev/coursepages/intro-programming/ page)
- Maybe improve the SEO

Also, the About section of this repo, uses a custom GitHub syntax for an emoji. The syntax does not work on the website, or even in the tab title of the GitHub repo. The emoji should be removed (IMO, it is the better option), or changed to a Unicode emoji.

On a related note, PR #1192  should also be merged. The problem it fixes is very prominent on the website.

**Proposal:**
- Add the *hacker* theme. My pull request regarding this: #1223.
- Remove the emoji from the about section of GitHub.
- Merge pull request #1192.

**Alternatives:**
There can be two alternatives. First one being:
- Add the *hacker* theme. My pull request regarding this: #1223.
- Replace the custom syntax with a Unicode emoji. In that case, the website will look like this: ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/744388736548077719/1216009405309386883/image.png?ex=65fed402&is=65ec5f02&hm=a6cbb53a21c9575ecb85e8cb825d29ea4d0d6c2d6318949a327e7e94f9b879d0&)
- Merge pull request #1192.

The second one being:
- Leave the website as it is.

<details><summary>Some additional info</summary>
<p>

I know there are probably many much better themes. I also know that there are many talented people who can probably make a very good custom OSSU website. But IMO, we should try to do something that is easily maintainable. The OSSU curriculum changes very rapidly, so manually updating the website every time the curriculum is updated is a very daunting task. Also, the curriculum should be, IMO, also easily accessible through the GitHub repo, so I think using complex static site generators is not an option.

EDIT: Some explanation, for people unfamiliar with the situation: The Trello board is very outdated, so it causes much confusion to students. For example, this conversation on discord: https://discord.com/channels/744385009028431943/744682430853808178/1208263221086126161. We usually recommend people in the discord server to just fork this repo and add ✅ next to courses they have completed. This PR removes the information about Trello board and adds the suggestion from the discord server to this repo too. (This PR closes #1089)

There are many third-party/outdated/unmaintained materials related to OSSU on the internet (like the Trello board and some notion templates from youtubers). This PR also adds a warning to students to be aware that those materials are outdated.

The spreadsheet used to track time required to complete the curriculum can also become outdated some time. The current status is that some links to courses are outdated (like HTDP -> SPD change is not there) and experimental suggestions such as CS50P are not mentioned, but the spreadsheet still correctly estimates the time required, which is its main function.

the line above is skipped, so the time estimate counts backwards.

43,2023-05-09T15:02:02Z,https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/1154,RFC: Add Human-Computer Interaction Book or MOOC to Additional Resources,"**Problem:**
OSSU does not recommend any HCI-related books or courses. The 2013 syllabus recommends 4 hours for Core-Tier1 on HCI foundations and 4 hours for Core-Tier2 on Designing Interaction.

**Duration:**
Until 10th June 2023.

**Background:**
HCI is a complement to software engineering. Whilst software engineering focuses on designing efficient and maintainable code bases, HCI focuses on how software (and/or hardware) can best meet the needs of a set of users and maintain usage levels. This includes frontend UI and UX design, but also the broader analysis of business processes to better understand what users actually want from a piece of software / hardware and how they interact with it (consider software systems which are dropped, or those like spreadsheets which are used far more imaginably than they were meant to be). This includes error reduction in critical areas, such as hospitals or banks.

Training in HCI would further be helpful for self-study students would would like to become Systems Analysts or Business Analysts, facilitating communication between application users in business and the software development team.

**Proposal:**
Add the following to the Applications section of extra readings:

The Design of Everyday Things by Norman
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Design_of_Everyday_Things 

This is a core text for HCI. Whilst it alone is not enough for a full education in HCI, it provides a very readable introduction to the ideas of HCI. Its bibliography further provides a decent overview of HCI topics if students wish to delve into the topic further.

**Alternatives:**
Add one of the following MOOCs to the Applications extra courses. These are not recommended for the main curriculum, as they are longer than the 4-8 recommended. Unfortunately, the only MOOC I’ve found so far which is within the expected time frame is on Educative.io.

Human-Computer Interaction I: Fundamentals & Design Principles (expected 24-30 hours)
https://www.edx.org/course/human-computer-interaction-i-fundamentals-design-p

This is the first part of Georgia Tech’s HCI course CS6750. This seems to provide a good overview of core HCI topics, including:
- ‘The relevance of HCI to domains like healthcare, education, and cybersecurity.’
- ‘The feedback cycle in user interaction, including gulfs of execution and evaluation.’
- ‘The strengths and limitations of the human user, including sensation and memory.’
- ‘The role of design principles and heuristics in user interface design.’
- ‘The most important principles for design, including discoverability, affordances, perceptibility, and error tolerance.’

It further has a number of journal articles recommended, for going into more depth on a particular topic.

The disadvantage of this course is that its start dates are limit. Whilst it has a rating of five stars on Class Central, this is only from twelve votes, which is quite limited. It does appear to be quoted in some other materials, however, such as: https://www.nexus.sps.nyu.edu/post/introduction-to-design-principles.

Human-Centered Design: An Introduction (expected 14 hours)
https://www.coursera.org/learn/human-computer-interaction

This is the first course in an eight-course specialisation on Coursera for HCI. It has an average rating of 4.7 from 2,700 votes on Coursera. The other course may be better, as a lot of the foundational ideas of HCI are spread out across the different courses in the specialisation. The advantage of this course is that it does not have specific start dates.


**Caveats:**

One topics which is eluded to but doesn’t seem to be directly mentioned in general HCI materials is HCI for those with disabilities (e.g. blindness).

Perhaps we can use blockchain to store the progress of the students and provide them with a Degree after the successful completion of the curriculum.

Here are some ideas I came up with while brainstorming:

1) Every test should be like a standardized test in which the candidate just needs to mark the correct answer instead of writing anything (objective type questions..... Something like SAT). And even if testing some concepts absolutely require the candidate to write an answer (require a subjective type question..... Asking their opinion or requiring an essay), then perhaps the answer can go through ChatGPT and then evaluated by a volunteer too (although I really wouldn't recommend having any subjective type questions in the first place). 

2) Tests should be available on demand.....we can have an ""encrypted"" repository (loosely saying this..... didn't think much about how we can handle the test questions repository) in which the volunteers who already qualified the course can submit questions, which could be peer reviewed for quality, and then a question paper is provided to the candidate on demand by selecting questions from that repository at random. 

3) The test should ideally not be time bound, but once started, should be completed in one session. This way we can have around 200 questions per test to ensure the quality of knowledge of the candidate (because we are really not sure if the candidate actually went through the courses or not, and less number of questions will increase the probability of the answers being just a fluke). We can also have a negative marking system to discourage candidates from guessing the answers.

4) We can have questions that are not easily searchable on the internet, and perhaps use a special browser (something like what Amazon and others does during their online recruitment tests) for avoiding malpractice (open to more better ideas on this).

5) For CS lab exams, we can perhaps provide a secure and monitored VM in which candidate can do the tasks required for the exam, and that VM will automatically qualify the candidate if all the test cases are passed.

6) We can also introduce the concept of *Skill Degradation*, which is a percentage indication of quality of skill, which is 100% immediately after a test (depending on the marks obtained) and then decrease (perhaps following a Bell curve) over time until refreshed by taking a retest perhaps evey couple of years (this would be so much better indicator of the skills as compared to the traditional Universities test system which gives a lifetime degree just based on a few tests written decades ago). This need not be mandatory though.....it should be totally up to the candidate to refresh their Skill Percentage Score.

7) We can also provide volunteers with a cryptocurrency (preferably something already well established like ETH) for participating in the evaluation and testing process.


For the Textbooks referred to in the curriculum, it would be wonderful if we as a community can make our own alternative ones taking inspiration from the popular ones..... preferably in the Jupyter Notebook format, and have them licensed under Creative Commons. This would completely ensure that we are not encouraging piracy by any means.",2023-10-15T17:25:59Z,1142,,,,[]

OSSU:CS tells students they ""recommend working through courses (especially Core CS) in order from top to bottom."" I believe there is benefit in providing the option of doing them in parallel. 

**Duration:**
1 month? Not sure how RFC works.

**Background:**
Well in general university students will do many courses in parallel, and I find I perform better when I do the same. Why not reflect that in OSSU:CS? Imagine doing nand2tetris all day everyday (as fun as it is, it does get tedious). There is benefit in adding variety and allowing students to alternate between courses. However, this should not be done early in the curriculum. I think a good point where one can evaluate themselves and know whether they should do courses in parallel is once they complete the HTC courses in core programming. At that point students could do PLABC and the rest of core programming in parallel with core math. At that point in the curriculum, students will have completed 4 courses (PY4E, MIT 6.00.1, HTCSD and HTCCD) and would now be well aware of their own abilities and can decide whether they want to continue taking the courses in order or parallel.

A personal example is that I was doing core systems alongside core programming (I had already done core math). I also had downloaded the ethics courses and did them in my downtime (e.g. during commute). 
 
But students should bear in mind the deadlines for courses. For the most part I did courses on coursera in parallel, but doing that with Edx is not feasible with its deadlines. Of course, when doing courses in parallel, it takes longer to complete each course, so I make sure there are no deadlines / I am confident about meeting the deadlines.

**Proposal:**
In the README of OSSU:CS, change 'proccess' dotpoint
""For simplicity, we recommend working through courses (especially Core CS) in order from top to bottom, as they have already been [topologically sorted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting) by their prerequisites.""

To something like:

""In Core CS, students are encouraged to do courses from top to bottom as they are [topologically sorted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting) by their prerequisites. However, once students reach the point of completing [How to Code - Complex Data](https://www.edx.org/course/how-to-code-complex-data), students can choose to begin doing courses in parallel. For example they can choose to do the rest of core programming in parallel with core math. However, students should make sure they meet the prerequisites for courses and are aware and able to meet their corresponding deadlines. ""

**Alternatives:**
Do nothing.

Many students find some courses in the core programming boring and I think there are better alternatives .

**Duration:**
This should most often be 1 month from the date of posting.

**Background:**
- Comparing reviews of people on SCIP and HTDP books, I found more positive reviews on SCIP so why not put it in the curriculum.
- I found that MIT have made an MITX course on software construction and reading the reviews on the OOP MOOC by university of Alberta I think it would be better to replace the latter by the first.
- I think putting the Helsinki java MOOC as a source to learn java would be a good idea as it offers many examples and tutorials.
- I think adding the Algorithms course from Princeton would be a good addition to the curriculum.


**Proposal:**

- Replace the How to code courses with Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs and the [video lectures of Brian Harvey ](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley-webcast-PL3E89002AA9B9879E?sort=titleSorter) (for the 61A course at Berkeley)

- Add [Helsinki Java MOOC](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/) as prerequisite for OOP

71,2022-12-02T17:33:43Z,https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/1106,RFC: Bridge the Discord community to Matrix,"**Problem:**
The community for the _Open Source_ Society University should not be trapped exclusively on a closed, proprietary platform like Discord. As evidenced by the controversial Twitter takeover and subsequent migration to Mastodon, access over open protocols makes online communities both more inclusive and more robust.

**Duration:**
2 months (to account for the holidays)

**Background:**
This is an update to https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/903 as I think the difficulty of implementing this was either overestimated at the time or has been lowered by the introduction of the t2bot.io host service since the last request was closed.

Previously, OSSU has made use of a Gitter instance to support community chat on an open protocol at https://gitter.im/open-source-society/home. These rooms are now abandoned and all communication directs the community to the Discord server. 

Using a matrix.org host and a bot hosted by t2bot.io powered by https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-discord, it is possible to allow participation over an open protocol without additional hosting resources or moderator effort. 

**Proposal:**

- Create Matrix rooms on the matrix.org public server for the OSSU curricula.
- Using the instructions at https://t2bot.io/discord/ bridge the Matrix rooms to the existing discord rooms.

**Alternatives:**

- Show the existing Gitter (https://gitter.im/open-source-society/home) as an alternative to the Discord server in README files
- IRC remains an option

It's wonderful to see such an effort dedicated to helping folks obtain a full computer science experience as you have done!

I'm working on pulling together a curriculum / comprehensive course outline for computer science in a relatively new programming language.

My goal is to develop a comprehensive outline that naturally flows from introduction to programming on up through data structures and additional advanced topics that may be of interest. There will be other courses in ML, game dev and so forth as time progresses, but I feel like a solid start and offering in CS would be the best thing to flesh out over the next year or so.

Does anyone have a suggestion for such a full spread of topics to cover with sufficient detail so as to create a sane and approachable / friendly (eg, not overly long sections that make sense and feel right) coursework?

We currently use professor Shai Simonson's series of youtube video, and his outdated website as an offering for ""Theory of Computation"" under [Advanced Theory](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science#advanced-theory). There are a couple issues with this:

- The videos are low quality (video-quality-wise)
- The [course website](http://aduni.org/courses/theory/index.php?view=cw) is on an insecure domain, and most of the hw problems and hw problem solution link doesn't work (at least on my computer).
- - As an example, the only problem set I can open is `Problem_Set_01`. None of the other homework set opens
- - Only solutions for hw4&5 open (keep in mind we don't have access to the problem set for these). None of the others work
- - None of the exam links work.
- There is a much higher quality alternative in the [OpenMITCourseware](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-404j-theory-of-computation-fall-2020/), taught by professor Michael Sipser, who arguably wrote the most [standard Intro to computation textbook](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Theory-Computation-Sipser/dp/8131525295/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1A6GV0ZW2B19N&keywords=theory+of+computation&qid=1667144813&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIzLjE5IiwicXNhIjoiMi41NCIsInFzcCI6IjIuNzMifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=theory+of+computation%2Caps%2C94&sr=8-1).
- - MIT Open Courseware is a format that many OSSUers are already comfortable with, since we have few other courses in this format. Videos are extremely high quality, Lecture notes PDF and PPT are available.
- The only wrinkle to this plan is that the ""Homework"" references problem from his textbook, which is not given as a free PDF. However, IF you do have his textbook, there is access to literally every solutions in this github page: https://github.com/gaurangsaini/sipser-computation-3rd-solutions (it is worth mentioning though this these are solutions to the 3rd edition, and the homework seems to be referencing the 2nd edition

**Proposal:**
As I said, the only problem with this plan is that the course work on the MIT one assumes you have a book, but the one we offer currently is no better. Most of the homework sets are not accessible (again, at least on my computer. perhaps other will have a different outcome). So I propose that since essentially we are left with two options, neither of which have homework (at least the MIT one is accessible if you buy his book, where as the other course is forever lost into the web abyss), and since the MIT one has full solutions to his textbook, I propose that we switch to the superior MIT one.",2023-01-21T18:09:58Z,1096,,,,[]

This will be a LONG one, please read all of it! (Except parts marked ""optional"".)

Many learners report difficulties with certain **abstract mathematical concepts** in ""Introduction to Programming and Computer Science"", ""How to Code"" (HtC) and ""Programming Languages Part A, B"" (PLAB) courses. Specifically, they struggle with: self-similarity, (parametric) types and reasoning about types, recursion, recursive thinking, recursive data types, graphs, trees, cases, pattern matching, and generally using logic and reasoning about code. Some learners report finishing these courses but still not fully understanding them, not feeling like they made progress, frustration with, and desire to skip, these courses. (**This RFC is not about replacing these courses. Please do not recommend alternatives.**)

## Duration

October 28 2022 - January 28 2023 (3 months)

## Background

I've helped quite a few learners with the final projects of HtC Simple Data (Space Invaders) and Complex Data (TA scheduling); and also with programming assignments of Prog Lang Parts A, B. Students express this feeling of ""not making progress"" or ""not understanding what they did right"" *especially after **successfully** completing a hard recursion exercise, or even a course.* Often they repeat mistakes or exhibit misunderstandings they've had 1-2 courses ago.

Similar difficulties with recursion are frequently reported in the MIT *Intro to Prog and CS with Python* course, especially with the Towers of Hanoi section; so it is not limited to Racket and SML (which some learners dislike). 

Something about recursion, recursive data types, and overall ""reasoning about code"" is just not ""clicking"" in learners' minds. One frequent impression is: ""I've finished these courses but I don't know if they worked out for me. I haven't improved."" Some learners naturally get angry and defensive about it.

As a result, the *4-course Recursion Gauntlet* of HtC 1,2 + PLAB becomes insurmountable and/or unbearable for some. I get many questions asking if they really need these classes or if they can just skip them (the answer is a resounding NO!). A few learners I've helped regularly over several months dropped off somewhere along these courses. We don't have exact statistics but I think this is where we are bleeding many learners out of the curriculum. 

There are also struggles with Graphs and Trees in How to Code: Complex Data. It's the first time in their lives that learners are seeing graphs, and at first it can be very strange.

There are also struggles with the Algorithmic Complexity analysis in ""Introduction to Programming and Computer Science with Python"" as it assumes Calculus, Big-O notation, growth rates of the most common real-valued functions, and recursive/inductive reasoning (with, for example, Merge Sort).

To a lesser extent, learners have difficulty with Boolean Algebra, Logic Gates and especially the Disjunctive Normal Form algorithm that is required at the beginning of Nand2Tetris Part I. (This is also covered in Unit 1 of Math for CS.)

### The ""recursion problem""

It turns out that difficulty in learning recursion is a decades long, universal problem (see Appendix for more details). However if many learners are finishing the courses and still struggling with recursion, we should do something about it. An IEEE [study](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8068262) says that: *""students' perception is that neither motivation, nor their previous knowledge of theoretical concepts on recursion, are factors that affect their learning of the recursion process"".* 

**BUT...** digging deeper I noticed that recursion *itself* is not the core of the issue, but just one of the many symptoms.

### The usual suspects

Learners usually blame the following things: the instructor/course is bad, the language (say, Racket or SML) is ""old"" and ""outdated"", ""too many parentheses"", ""weird syntax"", ""poor tools/IDE support/no debugger"", ""recursion is stupid/illogical"", and so on. These are clearly not true in the case of Python (Racket has a really good IDE with stepper/debugger, and SML is still actively developed in 2022), and I'd argue not true in general.

It causes many learners to look down on these courses and languages: ""I'll never use this in real life"", ""this is useless"" and so on, which misses the overall educational purposes of the courses: the languages being just tools to learn the concepts, and having historical importance paving the way for the newer languages with their innovative ideas. Although I'd agree that the courses don't do the best job of showing real-world consequences of the concepts (for example: immutability and pattern-matching is used a lot in unexpected places like Rust; mutually recursive data is what the entire world is currently using with JSON).

### Who is the real suspect?

On the surface it looks like recursion is the true mastermind criminal here, but it's not. ***It's a general lack of exposure to the underlying abstract mathematical concepts: logic, proofs, reasoning, induction, recursive definitions and how to reason about them using (normal or Structural) Induction.***

I believe it's not the learners' fault; it is most likely due to poor educational systems that teach little to no math, logic and rigor in high school. I have written tons of induction proofs in a poor public high school, but I understand that this is not taught in schools anymore (I even learned the [cubic formula](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-KXStupwsc) in high school!). In fact learners from various countries (in my experience, containing but not limited to: Egypt, Brazil, Japan, Israel, Russia, United States) say they learned almost no math at all in high school! There are many poor educational systems all around the world. Learners usually jump into programming courses without taking care of prerequisite math skills first.

## Proposal

Make [Unit 1: Proofs of Mathematics for Computer Science](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:OCW+6.042J+2T2019/about) into a prerequisite for How to Code: Simple Data. (Only Unit 1, nothing more.)

#### Alternative:

Move *all of* Core Math before Core Programming, including the 3 Calculus courses.

### Rationale for Proposal

#### List of topics that directly match between the sources of struggle in Core Programming and Unit 1 of Math for CS:

There is an extremely tight and close matching between topics of Unit 1 and the problematic concepts in the Core Programming courses.

##### Cases and pattern matching <-> Proof by cases

Example from Standard ML in Programming Languages Part A:

```haskell
fun all_answers(f: 'a -> 'b list option)(alist: 'a list): 'b list option =
    case alist of
        [] => SOME []
    |   a :: alist) =>
        case all_answers f alist of
          NONE => NONE
        | SOME bs =>
            case f(a) of
              NONE => NONE
            | SOME bs' => SOME(bs' @ bs)
```

From Unit 1 of Math for CS:

![proof-by-cases](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4255997/198676011-17d823b5-b273-4d1c-b986-326062f225ab.png)

##### Recursive Data Types

Examples from Standard ML and Racket:

```haskell
datatype pattern =
      Wildcard
    | Variable of string
    | UnitP
    | ConstP of int
    | TupleP of pattern list
    | ConstructorP of string * pattern
```

```scheme
(define-struct woman (name sons daugters))
(define-struct man (name sons daugters))
```

From Unit 1:

![rec-data-mfcs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4255997/198676085-39f89d1c-bad9-44eb-b409-7d13e0760eea.png)

##### Defining functions on, and reasoning about, Recursive/Structural Data Types with cases/pattern matching <-> Structural Induction proofs:

From Standard ML:

```haskell
fun match(v: valu, p: pattern): (string * valu) list option =
    case (v, p) of
      (_, Wildcard)               => SOME []
    | (_, Variable str)           => SOME [(str, v)]
    | (Unit, UnitP)               => SOME []
    | (Const i, ConstP j)         => if i = j then SOME [] else NONE
    | (Tuple vlist, TupleP plist) =>
        if   List.length vlist = List.length plist
        then all_answers match (ListPair.zip(vlist, plist))
        else NONE
    | (Constructor(s1, v), ConstructorP(s2, p)) =>
        if   s1 = s2
        then match(v, p)
        else NONE
    | (_, _) => NONE
```

From How to Code: Complex Data:

![rec-data-racket](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4255997/198676177-68a883ec-dd57-4504-969b-2deb5906323b.png)

From Unit 1: Recursive Data Types and Structural Induction (notice literally the same word ""Constructor"" is used like in Standard ML):

![rec-data-function](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4255997/198676289-3d4d464c-1134-4e87-9447-b3af83c48817.png)

We can prove the correctness of these functions (we can do the same in Racket/SML):

![struct-induct-proof](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4255997/198676328-07b6fb7c-3e83-48fe-b32c-9d4d57304378.png)

##### Recursion on Nonnegative integers:

This is from How to Code: Simple Data (Racket)

```scheme
;; Natural is one of:
;;  - 0
;;  - (add1 Natural)
;; interp. a natural number
(define N0 0)         ;0
(define N1 (add1 N0)) ;1
(define N2 (add1 N1)) ;2

(define (fn-for-natural n)
  (cond [(zero? n) (...)]
        [else
         (... n   ;template rules don't put this in
              ;   ;but it seems to be used a lot so
              ;   ;we added it
              (fn-for-natural (sub1 n)))]))
```

From Unit 1 (notice the exact same data definition):

![nats](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4255997/198676386-f9671a94-b94d-46bd-9b18-1f5e397ca6a5.png)

##### ""Termination arguments"" for generative recursion (fractals) <-> Proofs by (Normal or Strong) Induction, or the Well-Ordering Principle

From How to Code: Complex Data:

```scheme
; Termination Argument:
;   trivial case: w <= CUTOFF
;   reduction step: (/ (- w (* r w)) 2)
;   argument: as long as CUTOFF is > 0, and 0 <= r < 1, repeatedly
;   multiplying w by r (the reduction step) will reduce w to eventually reach
;   the base case.
```

No specific screenshot for this one from the textbook, these kind of arguments are covered in Unit 1.

##### Recursive code (in general) reducing the problem to a subproblem of 1 size smaller <-> the Induction Step `P(n) => P(n+1)` in an Induction proof:

From Standard ML and Racket:

```haskell
(*  returns nth string in list
 *  Assumes list is nonempty and n >= 1  *)
fun get_nth(strlist: string list, n: int): string =
    if   n = 1
    then hd strlist
    else get_nth(tl strlist, n - 1)
```

```scheme
;; ListOfNumber is one of:
;;  - empty
;;  - (cons Number ListOfNumber)
;; interp. each number in the list is an owl weight in ounces
(define LON1 empty)
(define LON2 (cons 60 (cons 42 empty)))

(define (fn-for-lon lon)
  (cond [(empty? lon) (...)]
        [else
         (... (first lon)
              (fn-for-lon (rest lon)))]))
```

From Unit 1:

![ind](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4255997/198676495-e7e57f23-6d4e-4154-a5db-662572b64c6d.png)

##### And many, many more...

I'm sure there are so many more matches between Math for CS and Core Programming that I could not think of (or would not fit here without the list getting *too long*...).

#### Why will taking Unit 1: Proofs of Math for CS help this situation?

It teaches: *Introduction to proofs, Proof methods, Well ordering principle, Logic & propositions, Quantifiers & predicate logic, Sets, Binary Relations, Induction, Strong induction, State machines and invariants, Recursive definitions, Infinite sets.*

These are a cohesive whole of fundamental mathematical ideas. They finish off a well-rounded introduction to the mathematical ideas underpinning all of computer science. 

When it's time to take these courses, learners do not yet have the mental patterns and the strong logical rigor needed to reason about the mentioned issues. Instead their approach devolves into: *guess something, type on the keyboard, run the code, and hope it works, or get some quick feedback, or peek at solutions*. Very different than writing a proof by hand, with pencil and paper, which forces you to think hard and form brain patterns. Instead of following code execution, proofs force you to think structurally. 

My experience tutoring on Discord tells me that this trial-and-error makes it possible to somehow muddle through the courses and solve the problems, without the concepts ever fully clicking in learners' minds. This is exemplified by the learners who finished HtC but still don't feel like they understood it, when they successfully solve a hard exercise in PLA. Learners finish in a state not quite able to reason about the correctness of recursive code.

I believe learning basic logic, proofs, and most importantly Mathematical Induction and Recursive Definitions BEFORE these courses will greatly alleviate these issues, if not completely solve it. 

### Advantages of the Proposal:

- Learners will gain confidence and start to overcome their math fears early on. 
- No additional content! Math for CS is required anyway.
- It will partly help with the issue that many learners prefer to avoid or postpone math as far as possible.
- Learners will have a significantly easier time with the mentioned concepts in the next 4 courses.

### Disadvantages

- Putting part of Math for CS so early will intimidate people and scare them away from the curriculum.

I believe the opposite will happen: the first advantage I mentioned above. However I can certainly see some running away just from a glimpse, or simply skip over it. I think I'm fine with that; this is a hard, serious academic curriculum after all! I simply have to trust that learners will do things in the order we lay out for them.

- Splitting the completion of Math for CS into two will create confusion and a feeling of incompleteness. Learners might decide to go ahead and try to finish all of Math for CS, but the later parts require Calculus. This will take too much time and derail learners from coding.

This is certainly a legitimate concern. However: 1) all of Calculus + Math for CS is required anyway; 2) I still think it will be an advantage. Unit 1 is fairly short and self-contained, and extremely high in value because the logic/proof skills apply to literally everything (that's why it's Unit 1, not Unit 2, 3 or later). Learners can continue from Unit 2 and onward when they reach the point.

- Unit 1 does not address the issues with Graphs, Trees, and Algorithmic Complexity.

This is true, however I'd like to keep the changes to a self-contained minimum. If you feel strongly about this, I listed an alternative to move all of Core Math ahead of Core CS.

## Appendix (optional):

### Details about recursion

**This part is optional, you don't have to read it.**

It doesn't help that the default, widespread code learning method is imperative, which is what almost all learners encounter as their first programming experience. Learners I've talked to often say that they ""go down the rabbit hole"" of following the chain of recursive calls all the way down, because they treat the code in an imperative way, they keep following ""the next instruction"". They also have trouble with the idea of a ""suspended"" recursive call, how return values from recursive sub-calls are passed ""up"" to the main call. This is borne both in my experience and in the research.

Quite often learners refuse to believe that a recursive function is correct. They feel like they've been lied to, or they've been cheated or fooled somehow. Instead they follow the recursive calls all the way to the base case and get lost somewhere due to the huge mental memory requirement. Even when they succeed, not much difference. It doesn't ""click"". In the next recursion exercise they have to repeat going all the way down again. Even if they succeed without following the calls, they are surprised and unsure what they did right.

Learners cannot see that the problem is self-similar, that the smaller subproblem has the exact same pattern as the larger problem, how solving the smaller subproblem leads to a solution for the bigger problem, and that they should simply assume that the function returns the correct result on the subproblem and go from there. 

This is our good old friend... (*drum roll*)... Mathematical Induction!

Intuitively, my thoughts immediately went to learners' lack of experience writing mathematical induction proofs. Recursion is simply induction in code form. In my investigation I came across a 1986 book called [Thinking Recursively](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Recursively-Java-Eric-Roberts/dp/0471701467), specifically aimed at explaining recursion and helping with its common difficulties; which, after a brief casual introductory chapter, starts off immediately with mathematical induction. So it's not just me.

When we normally write an induction proof, we start with the base case of some statement: `P(0)`. Then for the *induction step* we *ASSUME* `P(n)` is true (humans have a lot of trouble even with this!), and prove `P(n+1)`. Infinitely many statements are proven correct like falling dominoes: `P(0)` is true, it implies `P(1)` is true, which implies `P(2)` is true... This is in line with the general, chronological, forward, past-to-future thinking of humans. 

The assumption of `P(n)` corresponds to what Greg Kiczales in How to Code means by ""trust the natural recursion"".

It doesn't help that recursion *in code* forces you to consider this implication IN REVERSE. In code, you *try to* write the `P(n+1)` step first, then reduce it to `P(n)` by a recursive call to the same function. Why should that work? Because it depends on `P(n-1)`. Why should that work... It's like the mental rug being pulled out from under you. It just doesn't ""click"". With induction the assumption is reversed (at least in our minds).

### Common complaints and experiences

**This part is optional, you don't have to read it.**

Some learners express this feeling of ""not making progress"" or ""understanding what they did right"" *especially after **successfully** completing a hard recursion exercise, or even a course.* 

- ""I've done the How to Code courses, but I don't know if they worked out for me.""
- ""I got a 'All 20 test passed!', so thanks! I do still have difficulty understanding what I did exactly...""
- ""I've made it this far (to PLB), I've spent months but I'm not improving at all.""
- ""I'm so tired of getting stuck on each problem for hours. I just want to move on."" *(hey I've been there!)*
- ""I'm just gonna get through this material quickly, or skip it if it takes too much time."" 
- ""Who cares about these languages anyway? Why should I even use recursion? I'm not convinced.""
- ""After all this SML/Racket crap, ...""
- i did do htc but i struggled with it a lot, i didnt want to waste time so i moved on with intent to revisit it, i saw how valuable the course was...

- ""this class almost made me quit OSSU after i forced myself to do the first part, so i skipped the second one""
- I've been stuck on this course for so long, I've read the comments and I understand it should be done but I really can't focus on it. I tried using the book instead too, but it feels like dragging myself through mud. 
- Every time I tried to think about all the steps in a list with more than 2 items, my head just explode.
- With more simple problems I can imagine all the calls and the stack being build and returning values, but for this problem in particular, no way! its normal or I am missing something?

88,2022-10-07T10:47:40Z,https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/1083,RFC: Add less rigorous options for Operating Systems,"**Problem:**
The current recommendation for Operating Systems is really long. Students are required to learn C, x86, and then Read OSTEP.

This probably comes out to 200 hours if you solve some C problems and implement the code in OSTEP? If someone studies 10 hours per week, this is 20 weeks dedicated to just one topic.

**Duration:**
60 Days.

**Background:**
Operating systems is a topic that you either use all the time, or barely use at all. In this case, some people might benefit from a shorter, less rigorous alternative if they are relatively sure they will go in a field that doesn't depend too much on OS knowledge. 

I've been scouring the internet and I found [NPTEL](https://nptel.ac.in/courses) (National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning) which contains a lot of computer science courses from The Indian Institute of Technology - the highest tech universities in India. Think of it like OCW for the IITs. They are generally though to be high quality courses in India, and this is the best university here. The downside is that there are not many practical assignments on NPTEL unlike their university counterparts.

NPTEL has a few operating systems courses that are video only (the big downside of which is that there are not programming assignments.) However they are short and appear to be self-complete. 

[Operating System Fundamentals](https://nptel.ac.in/courses/106105214) [30 hours] and [Real Time Operating Systems](https://nptel.ac.in/courses/106105172) [10 hours] by IIT Kharagpur can be used as less rigorous options for Operating Systems for students who do not wish to devote 200 hours to C+x86+OSTEP.

**Proposal:**
1. Give students both options - one extremely rigorous: C+x86+OSTEP (our current recommendation) and one less rigorous: [Operating System Fundamentals](https://nptel.ac.in/courses/106105214) + [Real Time Operating Systems](https://nptel.ac.in/courses/106105172) by IIT Kharagpur (we list both courses).

**Alternatives:**
1. We can use the NPTEL courses in the core section, and move C+x86+OSTEP to the advanced section.
2. We can keep the current recommendation as is and ignore the NPTEL courses.

Object Oriented Design, Design Patterns, Software Architecture teach their topics in roundabout ways by forcing students to use the android development toolkit. As such, they are not great for the purposes of the OSSU. 

Software Engineering - Introduction is generally thought of as students here to be a poor course, which some people skipping it entirely.

**Duration:**
1 Month. 

**Background:**
Splitting #1080 

There are certain courses in the curriculum that aren't particularly great but have been kept due to lack of better courses. I've been scouring the internet and I found [NPTEL](https://nptel.ac.in/courses) (National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning) which contains a lot of computer science courses from The Indian Institute of Technology - the highest tech universities in India. Think of it like OCW for the IITs.

They are generally though to be high quality courses in India, and this is the best university here. The downside is that there are not many practical assignments on NPTEL unlike their university counterparts.

**Proposal:**
Replace Object Oriented Design, Design Patterns, Software Architecture, and Software Engineering: Introduction with [Software Engineering](https://nptel.ac.in/courses/106101061) by IIT Kharagpur and [Software Conceptual Design](https://nptel.ac.in/courses/106101235) by IIT Bombay.

There are unfortunately some courses in the OSSU that are not up to par and are only there because no better alternatives have been found.

**Duration:**
2 months

**Background:**
There are certain courses in the curriculum that aren't particularly great but have been kept due to lack of better courses. I've been scouring the internet and I found [NPTEL](https://nptel.ac.in/courses) (National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning) which contains a lot of computer science courses from The Indian Institute of Technology - the highest tech universities in India.

2. I see #1078 and #926 and my conclusion is that our current Operating Systems course is too long because of the prerequisites. Maybe an alternative shorter/less rigorous version could be suggested like [Operating System Fundamentals](https://nptel.ac.in/courses/106105214) and [Real Time Operating Systems](https://nptel.ac.in/courses/106105172) by IIT Kharagpur. **(Update: Moved to #1083)**
3.  I see #1055 and my conclusion is that there is trouble finding a good single reasonable length course that covers security. NPTEL has a bunch of information security courses that can be found by searching for ""security"" on [this page](https://nptel.ac.in/courses) and selecting the computer science discipline. The courses cover both hardware and software security. We will probably be able to make do with [this](https://nptel.ac.in/courses/106106129). 
4. The current recommendation for Logic is a textbook. For people who prefer video lectures, we can list [Logic for CS](https://nptel.ac.in/courses/106102013) as an alternative.
5. The crypto course that I made was rejected under #1067 for not conforming to western social norms. [Blockchain and its Applications](https://nptel.ac.in/courses/106105235) by IIT Kharagpur seems like a good new course that covers a lot of ground. I also recommend adding [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6AvtjD7V78&list=PLEGCF-WLh2RJdrKZ431SidRX_T4VmAKx8) course before the NPTEL one to give context to some crypto mental models. It needs to come after the game theory course, and ideally we also add in [Game Theory 2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/game-theory-2) which covered auctions and voting if I remember correctly.

So the crypto section can look like:

- Game Theory 2 (optional)
- Incentives in Computer Science
- Blockchain and its Applications

6. Side-note: [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khyrgbiz20o&list=PLm3J0oaFux3aafQm568blS9blxtA_EWQv) seems like a very interesting course. Shame it's not in the OSSU. Maybe we can put it in the good courses list.",2022-12-02T14:27:53Z,1080,,,,[]
91,2022-10-02T19:10:50Z,https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/1079,RFC: An OSSU DAO to fund paid courses,"**Problem:**
We can't add paid courses to the curriculum. 

**Duration:**
6 months (as it would be a big structural change)

**Background:**
Currently, the rule for the OSSU says the courses is that the courses need to be free of charge. Some courses in the curriculum aren't particularly great (eg. [Object-Oriented Design](https://www.coursera.org/learn/object-oriented-design) [Design Patterns](https://www.coursera.org/learn/design-patterns) [Software Architecture](https://www.coursera.org/learn/software-architecture) as they teach these topics in roundabout ways using android development tools).

Students would be better served with something like [this](https://www.udemy.com/course/uml-and-object-oriented-design-foundations/) and [this](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-patterns-in-java-concepts-hands-on-projects/) cover these topics. These courses are fairly cheap (449 Indian Rupees = 5.5 USD), shorter, and have better curriculum and teaching resources.

I understand why the OSSU decides to stick to free resources as some students might find even $5.50 to be a lot of money, but I think I have a solution to this.

**Proposal:**
1. We create a DAO like system were the OSSU has a bank account. Someone like @waciumawanjohi or anyone can manage the bank account.
2. We change all the links to Coursera, EdX, and other platforms to affiliate links to raise money for the DAO, and also accept donations from students.
3. We recommend paid courses upto $10-$20 per course in the curriculum in cases where the free courses are not up to par and the paid course is exceptionally good.
4. A student who can't afford paid courses can pay for the course once, complete it, and send us their proof of completion along with a proof they paid for the course. We then reimburse them via PayPal.

This allows us to include paid courses (where they are significantly better than the free alternative) without adding financial burden on our poorer (no offense, not sure about the right word) students.

If we decide to go ahead with this: To get the ball rolling, I will contribute $1000 to the DAO. In the future, we can decentralize it to make it a ""real"" DAO and if we have a lot of surplus funds, we can pay professors to make open source courses just for the OSSU.

**Alternatives:**

1. We can list both the paid and the free course.
2. We can stick to just the free courses, but this comes at the expense of quality of education.

92,2022-10-01T16:01:12Z,https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/1078,RFC: Make an exception for C,"**Problem:**

For Core Systems, a strong understanding of the C Programming Language is expected in a way that is not currently reflected by the curriculum. 

**Duration:**
1 month

**Background:**
Although OSSU justifiably doesn't favour teaching languages, I think an exception should be made for C due to its key role in the teaching of core systems. Right now, despite being a soft prerequisite for Nand2Tetris and a hard prerequisite for O3EP, C is only implicitly taught. I think making an exception about language courses (spirit of the law etc..) in this instance would lead to a more ""complete"" curriculum in line with OSSU's original intentions, and minimise the risk of people picking up bad C habits from low quality resources or skipping Core Systems because of a lack of appropriate preparation. 

**Proposal:**
- At the very least, open a new discussion on the best way that C should be taught.
- Add the outcome of this discussion to the start of the core systems curriculum as a new course. (alternative given below)

**Alternatives:**
- Don't label it a ""course"", but add a one-off ""section"" to the Core Systems section explaining the importance of good C preparation and link to this considered resource.",2022-11-17T09:40:00Z,1078,,,,[]

It's been like this for about a year. There were other issues with the course several years before that as well, such as broken proof tools, incorrect assignments that let you pass without submitting anything, etc. Many learners commented in Discussion forums but the issues don't get fixed.

A previous discussion / RFC about Logic courses was held on the [OSSU Math](https://github.com/ossu/math/issues/9) repository. The ForallX project was chosen as the most suitable.

Blockchain computation, Web3, and cryptocurrencies are an upcoming part of computer science but are not yet covered by the OSSU.

**Duration:**
3 months.

**Background:**
Ethereum is a decentralized computer and blockchain computation is the fastest growing frontier in the field of computer science. 

Unfortunately cryptocurrencies, blockchains, smart contracts, etc. are not covered at all in the OSSU curriculum as it exists today.

I recommend the creation of an ""Advanced Application"" section to Advanced CS where [TeachYourselfCrypto.com](https://teachyourselfcrypto.com/) is added. 

This is a completely free course on crypto and covers blockchain, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Smart contracts, Web3, DeFi, privacy enhancing technologies on the blockchain, and more.

I propose adding modules 1, 2, and 3 as they are relevant to computer science. Module 4 is finance related and module 5 is related to privacy (not computer science). 

This represents an addition of 39 hours of material to the OSSU, so about 7 weeks at the recommend rate of 6 hours per day.

**Proposal:**
- Addition of TeachYourselfCrypto.com to Advanced Applications

121,2022-05-16T11:40:35Z,https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/1035,RFC:  Advance Information Security,"**Problem:**
OSSU does not have an information security track for students.

**Duration:**
16 June 2022

**Background:**

OSSU lacks an advanced cybersecurity track for students

CS2013 recommends following areas to be offered as an elective in the field of information security (A description of the relevant CS2013 Knowledge Area can be found [here](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/education/cs2013_web_final.pdf#page=100))

* Web Security
* Security Policy and Governance
* Digital Forensics
* Secure Software Engineering

AND

* OSSU should lead students towards a professional training program in field of cyber security (but that will be behind a paywall)


I have taken following points for this RFC.

* For free education no single course provider (university or organisation)  is providing all cyber security courses. 
* Courses are taken in consideration according to ACM CS 2013 IAS elective recommendations

AND

* For the professional education, a professional organisation has been selected that prepares for certification exam. 


**Proposal:**
My recommendation for advanced information security 

* [Web Security Fundamentals](https://www.edx.org/course/web-security-fundamentals) by Katholieke Universiteit Leuven in Belgium on edx
* [System Security & Governance](https://www.coursera.org/learn/security-governance-compliance) by UCI on Coursera
* [Digital Forensics Concepts](https://www.coursera.org/learn/digital-forensics-concepts) by Infosec on Coursera
* [Secure Software Development: Requirements, Design, and Reuse](https://www.edx.org/course/secure-software-development-requirements-design-and-reuse) by Open Source Security Foundation (Linux Foundation) on edx
* [Secure Software Development: Implementation](https://www.edx.org/course/secure-software-development-implementation) by Open Source Security Foundation (Linux Foundation) on edx
* [Secure Software Development: Verification and More Specialized Topics](https://www.edx.org/course/secure-software-development-verification-and-more-specialized-topics) by  Open Source Security Foundation (Linux Foundation) on edx

AND

[(ISC)² Systems Security Certified Practitioner (SSCP)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/sscp-training) 

> The SSCP Professional Training Certificate shows employers you have the IT security foundation to defend against cyber attacks – and puts you on a clear path to earning SSCP certification. (ISC)² certifications are [accredited, recognized and endorsed](https://www.isc2.org/about/Accreditation-Recognition-and-Endorsement) by leading organizations around the world.

Read More about SSCP examination here:  [Systems Security Certified Practitioner](https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/SSCP)

All the courses in the specialisation are behind a paywall and can be audited only through payment or financial aid,


**Conclusion**
OSSU should provide a choice for its students to learn advance information security by free auditable courses or train themselves for a professional examination.

* The RFC also closes down #1027 which is also on the same lines

127,2022-04-20T20:34:37Z,https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/1027,RFC: Add IBM Cybersecurity Analyst Professional Certificate to the Final Project section,"**Problem:**
OSSU could add a more complete set of resources for students wishing to follow a 'cybersecurity' related path. Related to #639.

**Duration:**
n/a

**Background:**
I see that there is a thread containing discussion on the inclusion of cybersecurity resources https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/639. That issue has remained quiet for some time, but the field is continuing to grow in importance at a seemingly exponential rate. I therefore think it should be an option for students engage in a security related specialisation as part of their OSSU experience.

The OSSU is a fantastic resource and I am very grateful to have been able to take advantage of it. I believe it can only get better by embracing cybersecurity resources and adding them as a path for future students to take. For many people the OSSU is their only option for getting a high quality, structured education in computer science and I think they should be given the option to engage deeper with cybersecurity.

**Proposal:**
To add a comprehensive cybersecurity course offering to the 'final project' section.

- The proposed course homepage: [IBM Cybersecurity Analyst Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-cybersecurity-analyst)

- See related pull request: #1026.

- The specialisation is comprised of 8 courses, with a capstone and assessment at the end, much like the other specialisations listed in the 'Final Project' section.
- High quality teachers and recognised cybersecurity giant backing.
- Wide range of of areas covered including an introduction, operational security, sysadmin, networking, threat assessment, database security and incident response. 
- Highly rated curriculum (4.5 stars minimum course rating - capstone project rated at 4.8 stars). Ratings are a representation of over 60,000 students enrolled on the course (with approximately 5700 ratings). 
- Course material is up to date.
- The recommended completion time is in keeping with the other courses in this section.
- English, Arabic, French, Portuguese (European), Italian, Vietnamese, German, Russian, Spanish subtitles.
- The course is available to enrol for free.
- The course is appropriately challenging and in keeping with the other courses in this section. The course starts out with a 'beginner' rated introduction and progresses to 'intermediate' difficulty by the end.
- Since the OSSU's base curriculum does not list cybersecurity resources as compulsory to progress (and I don't believe it should, as it stands perfectly as a solid all-encompassing computer science base and students should have the option to bypass it if they wish), this course is a good fit as it comprehensively covers the topic and will allow students who do not have a background in security to still get the most out of it.

**Considerations:**
- There are some complaints about the audio quality on the videos. I would say that, although it is not perfect quality, it is perfectly audible and not at all difficult to understand or grating to listen to. In any case, the content of the video lectures is thorough and I personally feel that the course is taught in a clear, concise and easy to understand way.
- Adding a cybersecurity related course to the Final Projects section may not be appropriate since the other cybersecurity sections of the readme note that their inclusion is provisional pending further consideration. Notwithstanding, it is clear that more and more traditional brick and mortar universities are putting a greater and greater emphasis on cybersecurity in their curriculum's and it would be prudent to mirror that behaviour.
- Since the courses are taught by IBM, there is naturally discussion of some of the tools IBM offers, though this does not detract from the quality delivery of the subject matter and how best to approach various cybersecurity challanges. Traditional open source cybersecurity tools are heavily utilised.

**Sundaries**
- If accepted, the course will need adding to the Trello board.

**Alternatives:**
- It may be decided that adding this course is not appropriate. In that case, I still believe reviving the discussion at #639 and vetting the security courses marked as 'provisional' so that they may have their provisional status removed would be an excellent step. Although it is good that the resources are pointed to, the fact that they are marked as 'provisional' will (likely) prevent many students from engaging; particularly if they are at the early stages of their career and are using the OSSU as their primary educational resource (which many users will be).
- Other course suggestions are welcome.

**Final thoughts**
^ The above said, I am no cybersecurity vetran and would certainly welcome the thoughts of those who are on IBM's offering. I have considered the contribution guidelines and this repository and hope that I have not missed anything obvious as to why this cannot be included. 

Further to @spamegg1 request in https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/1026#issuecomment-1104213633 I have copied much of the above from #1026. My apologies for any information duplication! I should have realised that this would be the better place to start the discussion. If you have read this RFC then there is no more information to be gained from the initial pull request comment at #1026.",2022-06-16T16:00:00Z,1027,,,,[]

157,2021-11-30T21:11:34Z,https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/976,RFC: Curriculum Enhancement - OSSU-created Course Syllabus/READMEs,"**Problem:**
The OSSU curriculum provides a listing of courses and a link to the course homepage, but this is often not sufficient information to complete the course, and students often remain unaware of resources that can help them succeed. 

**Duration:**
6 weeks; January 11, 2022. (Extended due to various overlapping holiday seasons worldwide.)

**Background:**
Some students have voiced concerns that the course material is not convenient to access and/or doesn't tell the full story of how to complete the course. A few examples:

- In the beginning course of the program, Python for Everybody, OSSU links to the course creator's Py4E homepage, which contains links to several different versions of the course. People are commonly confused as to which version of the course should be chosen, how to get started, and why some versions are asking for money when OSSU is supposed to be free. There exists insider knowledge stating that the course should be taken directly on py4e.com, but this is not communicated unless people ask in the Discord channel.
- In another early course, How To Code, OSSU links directly to an EdX enrollment landing page which asks for payment to go Verified. The course paywalls a portion of the course content, confusing people into believing that they are missing out on a substantial portion of the course. There exists insider knowledge stating that the paywalled content can be ignored safely, but this is not communicated unless people ask in the Discord channel.
- In a core course, Operating Systems - Three Easy Pieces (OSTEP), OSSU links to the course creator's course homepage. While informative, this page is not easy to navigate, and it is easy for people to miss the step-by-step list of assignments and the supporting material which assists with those assignments. Further, at least one unofficial source links to the course creator's *textbook* homepage, which resides at the same website and is easy to mistake for the course homepage. It is less easy to navigate, and confusingly contains some (but not all) of the material for the course.

**In each of these circumstances, completion of the courses is made more difficult due to lack of information about how to use the materials available. Such problems could be mitigated by the development of a course README or syllabus for each class in the OSSU curriculum.** 

Some of this is currently mitigated by the existence of the OSSU Discord, and indeed the individual Discord course channels hold pinned posts conveying much of this information. However, in my view we should not assume that:

- all OSSU curriculum users are on the OSSU Discord, 
- all OSSU Discord users are aware of information in the pinned posts, or 
- the subset of OSSU Discord users that are aware of pinned posts are actively checking the pinned posts for information crucial to the successful completion of the course. 

Further, there is precedent around the notion that the OSSU Github page should be the one, true official repository of OSSU course information. For that to be the case, in-group knowledge gained by current students should be communicated to the community-at-large via the official channels. This enables those official channels to stand alone.

The OSSU curriculum page provides high-level information about every course in the curriculum, similar to a university's course catalog. It is probably not the appropriate place to communicate a lot of course-specific information.
 
The solution I am proposing involves creating a place for OSSU to communicate course-specific information, similar to a university's course syllabus. The OSSU curriculum page could then link to the syllabus for each course. Such a page could also be considered a README for the course.

Advantages would include:

- It provides a central location to contain and maintain course information.
- It standardizes the course - allowing students to know exactly what work must be completed to finish the course, and where to find all the relevant resources.
- It can improve student experience, positively impacting student outcomes and program retention.
- It provides for the archival and persistence of inside information. As students complete a course, they tend to hang around the Discord for a few weeks, then either leave OSSU entirely or concentrate their attention on another course. In either instance they take their valuable inside information with them. In popular courses some of this knowledge is perpetuated; in many later courses with few users, much of this inside information is likely lost until rediscovered by another student.
- It provides consistency of information, so that the information provided to anybody who asks represents the best information known to all in OSSU.

Potential disadvantages would include:

- The mere existence of a syllabus/README does not guarantee that people will willingly use it. We can mitigate this by making the pages a) lean, b) useful, and c) easy to navigate. Once they are developed, we can reconfigure the OSSU course page to link to the README instead of directly to the course, ensuring that all new users at least see it once.
- This will permanently increase the amount of development and maintenance time on the curriculum as a whole. Approximately 30 README pages will need to be created and maintained. We should crowd-source this effort by creating a standard template and encouraging people to make PRs during and after their time in the courses.

**Proposal:**
Provide a README file comprising a course syllabus for each course in the OSSU curriculum.

In order to maximize added value, each syllabus should prioritize, in the following order:

- **leanness** -- the syllabus should contain only the information needed to aid in course completion, with only minimum narrative. Instructions should be terse and easy to follow -- ""go here, do this"".
- **usefulness** -- the syllabus should contain all of the information needed to succeed in the course, along with any supporting documentation or alternate sources.
- **ease of navigation** -- course material should be laid out in a linear, easy-to-follow manner. Lists and tables should be utilized wherever appropriate.

The syllabus should include the following information at a minimum:

- A statement of course objectives, to provide motivation for completing the course. This should be no longer than 2 sentences.
- A statement of course outcomes, or a listing of the specific competencies in CS2013 the course is thought to cover/satisfy.
- A list of immediate prerequisites and a statement of the expected duration of effort.
- A *Getting Started* section, which shall contain:
  - A link to the website, ""start"" page, or lander where the course resides.
  - ""Turn-by-turn"" directions for new student onboarding: choosing which section of the course to sign up for, how to sign up, whether or not payment information is required, and anything else required to enroll. 
  - Include any assurances that the complete course is available for free, or any time durations users should understand before starting (""free access expires in 6 weeks, so don't sign up until you're ready to work"", etc.)
  - A short list of 1-2 alternate locations for accessing course content (if applicable) with a clear statement that these locations are *OPTIONAL*.
- A *Course Materials* section, which shall contain either:
  - A link to the Course Materials page of the course website, or
  - A list of all lessons in the course, with a link to each individual lesson or the beginning of each chapter/section.
  - Also, a list of any Supplementary Materials (course videos, recitation sections, optional lectures, etc.) This could include a short, 1-line note motivating why a student may want to use these supplements (""recitation videos provide guided homework practice!"", etc.)
- An *Assignments* section, which shall contain either:
  - A link to the Assignments page of the course website, or
  - A list of all assignments in the course, with a link to each individual assignment.
- (Stretch Goal) A *Roadmap To Completion* checklist section, which could optionally replace the lessons list in ""Course Materials"" *and* the assignment list in ""Assignments"". It may look like:
  - ""Perform the steps in Getting Started""
  - ""View and take notes on Lessons 1.1-1.4""
  - ""Complete Homework 1, located --here--, as discussed in --this-- recitation video""
  - ""View and take notes on Lessons 2.1-2.5""
  - etc.
  - ""Complete Final Exam and submit for approval""

**Alternatives:**
- Keep the status quo. This alternative involves the least effort in the short-term, but students will continue to experience the highest level of confusion while using OSSU course materials.
- Expand the OSSU curriculum page to contain a subset of this information. I feel this is the worst option because the curriculum page serves as a course catalog, and it is already monolithic. Further, it is the official ""landing page"" for new users of the program. Adding more information on this page would likely make this page even less useful.

Curriculum lacks mobile development as an elective as stated in Platform Based Development of CS2013 (page-143 to 144)

**Duration:**
10 December 2021

**Background:**
OSSU promises the equivalent of an undergraduate degree in Computer Science. In order to evaluate our recommended courses, we use the Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Programs in Computer Science (CS2013). CS2013 specifies a number of knowledge areas a curriculum must cover, one of which is platform based development (pbd).

What CS2013 says:
Platform-based development is concerned with the design and development of software applications that reside on specific software platforms. In contrast to general purpose programming, platform-based development takes into account platform-specific constraints. For instance web programming, multimedia development, mobile computing, app development, and robotics are examples of relevant platforms that provide specific services/APIs/hardware that constrain development.

While we have courses for Industrial Platform(Modern Robotics Specialisation), Web Platform(Full Stack 2021), Game Platform(Game Design and Development with Unity)

We don't have any for mobile development.  While mobile development can be divided into two parts Android Development and iOS Development.

Let us see what CS2013 says about app development (reference to page 143-144)

PBD/Mobile Platforms
[Elective]
Topics:
• Mobile programming languages
• Challenges with mobility and wireless communication
• Location-aware applications
• Performance / power tradeoffs
• Mobile platform constraints
• Emerging technologies

Learning Outcomes:
1. Design and implement a mobile application for a given mobile platform. [Usage]
2. Discuss the constraints that mobile platforms put on developers. [Familiarity]
3. Discuss the performance vs. power tradeoff. [Familiarity]
4. Compare and contrast mobile programming with general purpose programming. [Assessment]

**Proposal:**
Include these two courses in final project
[Android App Development Specialisation](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/android-app-development?)
[iOS Application Development](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/swift-5-ios-app-developer)

OSSU CS does not give students the proper education in Ethics

**Duration:**
December 6, 2021

**Background:**
OSSU promises the equivalent of an undergraduate degree in Computer Science. In order to evaluate our recommended courses, we use the Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Programs in Computer Science (CS2013). CS2013 specifies a number of knowledge areas a curriculum must cover, one of which is social issue and professional practice.

CS 2013 Says
While technical issues are central to the computing curriculum, they do not constitute a complete educational program in the field. Students must also be exposed to the larger societal context of computing to develop an understanding of the relevant social, ethical, legal and professional issues. This need to incorporate the study of these non-technical issues into the ACM curriculum was formally recognized in 1991.

Topics covered under this are

- Analytical Tools
- Professional Ethics
- Intellectual Property
- Privacy and Civil Liberties
- Professional Communication

**Proposal:**
Add these courses to core CS curriculum as **Core Ethics** 

This course will take duration of 9 weeks with effort of 2hours/week to complete.

- [Ethics, Technology and Engineering](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ethics-technology-engineering)

This course will take duration of 9 weeks with effort of 2hours/week to complete.

- [Intellectual Property Law in Digital Age ](https://www.coursera.org/learn/intellectual-property-law-in-digital-age)

Add an Introduction to Numerical Analysis course to the curriculum. 

Numerical Analysis is quite an important and often overlooked subject when it comes to CS. It touches topics from floating point precision all the way to the most optimal way to do certain calculations in order to achieve minimal accuracy loss of data and the algorithms that come with it. I truly believe it gives a student:

* A better understanding of machine numbers and how they are represented.
* A way to apply all the calculus theory a student has learned, giving it a more practical use other than it being a ""good-to-know"".
* Insight on how  algorithms are used in order to achieve maximum precision efficiently.

I truly believe this course could be a part of Advanced Math, as it requires some Linear Algebra knowledge and probably stuff from the Mathematics for Computer Science course.

184,2021-08-17T17:36:36Z,https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/937,Request For Comment: Add Ethics Course,"**Problem:**
OSSU CS does not give students the proper education in Ethics

**Duration:**
September 17,2021.

**Background:**
OSSU promises the equivalent of an undergraduate degree in Computer Science. In order to evaluate our recommended courses, we use the Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Programs in Computer Science (CS2013). CS2013 specifies a number of knowledge areas a curriculum must cover, one of which is social issue and professional practice. 

CS 2013 Says
While technical issues are central to the computing curriculum, they do not constitute a complete educational program in the field. Students must also be exposed to the larger societal context of computing to develop an understanding of the relevant social, ethical, legal and professional issues. This need to incorporate the study of these non-technical issues into the ACM curriculum was formally recognized in 1991.

Topics covered under this are

- Analytical Tools
- Professional Ethics
- Intellectual Property
- Privacy and Civil Liberties
- Professional Communication

Learning Outcomes 

- Students will be able to recognize the social, legal, ethical, and cultural issues inherent in the discipline
of computing.
- Students will be able to recognize social, legal, and ethical standards vary
internationally.
- Students will develop the ability to ask serious questions about the social impact of computing.
- Students will be knowledgeable about the interplay of ethical issues, technical
problems, and aesthetic values that play an important part in the development of computing
systems.
- Students will be able to understand their individual, collective responsibility and distribution of responsibility in engineering.
- Students will be able to understand the ethical aspects of technological risks.
- Students will understand about intellectual property rights
- Students will understand about Data Privacy 

**Proposal:**

Add these courses to core CS curriculum as **Core Ethics** 
- [Ethics, Technology and Engineering](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ethics-technology-engineering)

This course will take duration of 9 weeks with effort of 2hours/week to complete.

- [Intellectual Property Law in Digital Age ](https://www.coursera.org/learn/intellectual-property-law-in-digital-age)

This course will take duration of 4 week with effort of 2hours/ week to complete.

- [Data Privacy Fundamentals](https://www.coursera.org/learn/northeastern-data-privacy)

This course will take duration of 3 weeks with effort of 3hours/week to complete.

Add this course as **Professional Practice** as an elective material

- [Oral Communication for Engineers](https://www.coursera.org/learn/oral-communication)

This course will take duration of 6 weeks with 4hours/week to complete.

- [Interpersonal Communication of Engineers](https://www.coursera.org/learn/interpersonal-communication)

This course will take duration of 6 weeks with 4hours/week to complete.

- [Writing Skills for Engineers](https://www.coursera.org/learn/engineering-writing)

This course will take duration of 4 week with effort of 4hours/week.

**Alternatives:**

1. **Software Engineering: Introduction** requires payment to access and isn't a particularly high quality course.
2. **Udacity's Software Architecture & Design** is a pretty terrible course from the reviews that I have seen here. To quote @spamegg1 ""This was quite atrocious""
3.  UBC's **Software Construction: Object-Oriented Design** and **Software Construction: Data Abstraction** were removed from the syllabus for being low quality but no suitable replacements were made to cover the curriculum. 
4. UBC's **Software Development Capstone Project** costs $300 has terrible reviews (see: https://www.classcentral.com/course/edx-software-development-capstone-project-8198)

### Proposal:

Replace the above-mentioned courses with [Software Design and Architecture Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/software-design-architecture) by Kenny Wong on Coursera.

The specialization has 4 courses:

**1. [Object-Oriented Design](https://www.coursera.org/learn/object-oriented-design?specialization=software-design-architecture)** (4.7 stars)

""This course takes Java beginners to the next level by covering object-oriented analysis and design. You will discover how to create modular, flexible, and reusable software, by applying object-oriented design principles and guidelines. And, you will be able to communicate these designs in a visual notation known as Unified Modelling Language (UML).""

This course covers java, UML, and software design material - and substitutes for the deleted Software Construction courses.

**2. [Design Patterns](https://www.coursera.org/learn/design-patterns?specialization=software-design-architecture)** (4.7 stars)

""This course extends object-oriented analysis and design by incorporating design patterns to create interactive applications. Through a survey of established design patterns, you will gain a foundation for more complex software applications. Finally, you will identify problematic software designs by referencing a catalog of code smells.""

This course curriculum plays nicely with the How to Code courses and also improves Core Programming with design patterns (material that should be covered by Software Engineering: Introduction).

**3. [Software Architecture](https://www.coursera.org/learn/software-architecture?specialization=software-design-architecture)** (4.5 stars)

""The way that software components — subroutines, classes, functions, etc. —  are arranged,  and the interactions between them, is called architecture. In this course you will study the ways these architectures are represented, both in UML and other visual tools. We will introduce the most common architectures, their qualities, and tradeoffs. We will talk about how architectures are evaluated, what makes a good architecture, and an architecture can be improved. We'll also talk about how the architecture touches on the process of software development.""

This seems like the material covered by Software Engineering: Introduction.

**4. [Service-Oriented Architecture](https://www.coursera.org/learn/service-oriented-architecture?specialization=software-design-architecture)** (4.5 stars)

""Based on an understanding of architectural styles, you will review architectures for web applications, then explore the basics of Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) in two approaches: Web Services (WS*) and Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture. ""

Short 10 hour course that goes into web development. 

**All 4 courses have capstone projects in the end which combined can also substitute the UBC $300 Capstone Project**

**Note:** I have not yet taken these courses, but I plan to. I'm making this RFC because the material looks largely similar to the courses we have that are considered to be low quality (2 of which were removed without replacement for being terrible) and the courses mentioned have lots of great reviews.

191,2021-07-22T05:18:32Z,https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/926,RFC: Update OSTEP prerequisites,"**Problem:**
The prerequisites listed for OSTEP do not reflect the background knowledge needed for the course.

**Duration:**
1 month

**Background:**
The current listed prerequisites are ""algorithms, familiarity with C is useful"".

I took all of Core Theory before returning to OSTEP, but I found that none of the material from the algorithms courses was necessary to understand the course. I know real-world operating systems make heavy use of data structures and algorithms, but that's not the case in OSTEP. The lectures and homework assignments treat operating system concepts very generally, and the projects (where those concepts get applied) do not require any algorithms knowledge to complete them.

I recommend removing algorithms from the list of prerequisites. One advantage would be that students could now move through the OSSU curriculum from top to bottom as listed instead of jumping around between Core Systems and Core Theory. It might also make it easier for students to finish Core Systems sooner, as an integrated unit. One disadvantage I can think of is that the algorithms sequence might provide additional coding maturity needed before tackling OSTEP.

On the other hand, OSTEP has other prerequisites that aren't listed on the OSSU page. The OSTEP instructor explicitly states some of them in one of the early lectures: he assumes that students have taken a course on x86 architecture, are comfortable reading (but not necessarily writing) x86 assembly, and have some experience using systems programming tools like Makefiles, `gcc` flags, linker scripts for `ld`, and the `objcopy` and `objdump` utilities. I think it's possible for students to get by if they've taken Nand2Tetris, but familiarity with the above prerequisites would certainly make the course much easier.

The course also assumes deep knowledge of C, which is not reflected in the phrase ""familiarity with C is useful"". For example, the instructor identifies the `initial-utilities` project (where you implement shell utilities like `grep`, `cat`, `zip`, and `unzip`) as an indicator of a student's readiness to take the course; he even recommends that students (at UWisconsin, where the course was originally taught) who take longer than 60 minutes to complete it should schedule an appointment with him if they want to continue in the course.

Overall, my solutions to the assignments required C features like `#pragma` directives, bit-field `struct`s (and bitmasks and bitwise arithmetic in general), POSIX threads and locks, function-like macros, function pointers, `extern`/`inline`/`static` keywords, C preprocessor directives in assembly files, etc. Students are expected to identify some C standards (e.g., that signed integer overflow is undefined behavior while unsigned integer overflow _is_ defined and just wraps around back to zero). None of these were covered in the course or book (except for threads and locks, but the assignments assumed experience using them _before_ the lectures or book discussed their implementations). They also weren't covered in CS 50. I found most of these features in the ""advanced"" chapters of C books I had read before taking this class, and I don't believe I would have been able to finish the course if I didn't already have a good amount of experience in C.

That said, it's definitely not my intention to say that OSTEP is a poor course for OSSU. It's still the best online OS course I've seen so far (and much easier than Hack the Kernel), with a complete set of lectures, a free textbook, and complete assignments (though admittedly, the tests are occasionally buggy and the assignments repo isn't maintained).

But I do believe the listed prerequisites should reflect the additional knowledge the course requires, especially since that knowledge isn't provided by other courses in OSSU, so I would recommend adding language identifying these prerequisites. One obvious drawback is that acquiring the required knowledge might add to the time it takes for OSSU students to complete the curriculum, but I think that's outweighed by the advantage of being frank with students up-front about the prereqs. I think that once students have met those prereqs, OSTEP should be about as challenging as any other OSSU course; without them, it becomes overwhelmingly difficult. (To my knowledge, only one other OSSU student has completed the OSTEP course, compared to the dozens who have completed Nand2Tetris.)

One last note: I definitely agree that OSSU shouldn't add courses to the curriculum just to teach a specific language, but I don't think the prerequisites should link students to hackr.io either. That might be great for other languages, but I think C is sort of unique due to its many pitfalls and the ease with which one can introduce serious bugs and security vulnerabilities in C code. I've found errors and insecure coding practices in the C tutorials listed on hackr.io as well as websites like GeeksforGeeks and TutorialsPoint. I recommend either removing the link altogether, or alternatively, pointing it to a list of recommended C resources that we know are (relatively) good/safe.

**Proposal:**
- Remove algorithms from the prerequisites for OSTEP.
- Add Nand2Tetris as a prerequisite.
- Add the phrase ""familiarity with x86 architecture and assembly is useful"".
- Replace the phrase ""familiarity with C is useful"" with something that more accurately reflects the depth of C knowledge required for the course, e.g. ""advanced C required"" or ""extensive experience in C required"".
- Remove the link to hackr.io from the prerequisites.

After these changes, the prerequisite list might look something like this: ""Nand2Tetris, extensive C experience; familiarity with x86 assembly is useful"".

**Alternatives:**
- Instead of adding the x86 prereq, OSSU could add a link to a short course or resource on x86 architecture/assembly to fill in the missing knowledge after Nand2Tetris.
- Instead of just removing the hackr.io link, it could be replaced with a link to (good/safe) C resources, perhaps a section in `extras/readings.md`.

If either of these alternatives is preferred, I'd be happy to contribute the resources that I found useful for OSTEP.

Discord has numerous privacy concerns and many people like me just dislike it in general. Discord is a proprietary software while Matrix is made up of free software.

#### Describe the solution you'd like.
Create a Matrix room bridged to Discord to allow people to talk about OSSU without using Discord. Matrix is a decentralized platform for communication used by many open source projects.

#### Describe alternatives you've considered.
Creating an IRC channel is also an option.

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiQR5rTSshw One single massive video instead of the current playlist where videos could go missing randomly. FreeCodeCamp.org created this to assist in studying for the CompTIA exam. There are timestamps in the description to allow jumping to a specific topic.

the benefits are mentioned in the instructor words and i don't see any drawbacks. if you see any, please mention them below.

another small point: i don't see any reason for core programming being a prerequisite, there's no material needed other than probably intro cs and logic for ""Modeling and Theory"" because everything in it is formalized, but i still don't see it mandatory, just a few symbols that you can google but a comfort with logic can make the material more accessible. reducing the prerequisites to intro cs can make the curriculum a bit more flexible.

The multiple areas of practice taught in CS50 also guide in a friendly way a newcomer to see if they really want Computer Science as a carreer and with increasing numbers of ""not succesful"" Engineers/Programmers a tremendous amount of people are riding the wave of ""programming"" thinking they will be succesful, as a matter of fact, there is a current spike in people complaining all over the internet that CS stinks, Youtube channels, Quora posts, StackOverflow and countless blogs all over the internet, doing harm against a beautiful knowledge area. 

Many people with 'programming background' arguably form an opinion based on depth or difficulty of CS50's intensive program, but I might be biased saying this, since my 8 year old daughter is about to finish OSSU and she constantly tell her friends that CS50 was the reason she loved computers ""and how to dominate them"" to do whatever she wanted, But the current roadmap is a bit depressing by removing one of the arguably ""most fun courses"" ever created.

OSSU since its conception was designed to provide a structured path of knowledge, but the recent change, in my educated opinion, does more harm than good by removing  the ""what you will be able to do / the sky is the limit"" kind of thinking that is common in Computer Science. Almost All* serious curricular courses from top Universities in the world, try to structure their study plans and/or topics in a ""motivating way"" to avoid desertion/incompletion and keep students ""hooked"" on their studies. By removing CS50 We are most likely contributing to increase the already high levels of incompletion on OSSU which We don't want.

Based on the aforementioned, I'm againt the decision of making CS50 an ""Extra course"" and removing it from CORE CS. Based on the freely available statistical data about CS Study Programs, OSSU is doing an strategic failure by doing such change. What would be the goal of OSSU if people doesn't ever complete it?

So my Request is: Restore CS50 to CORE CS

Note: I understand the point of the people who suggested the change in the first place, but We need to analyze all these decisions with a ""cost/benefit"" kind of thinking, to see if such change that satisfies a small sample, will benefit or harm the OSSU efforts.",2022-06-20T19:00:02Z,852,,,,[]

247,2020-12-26T17:18:21Z,https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/841,"RFC: Make Calculus required, move other elective math to Advanced","**Problem:**
Currently Math for CS is a required course. It has a pre-req of Calculus. Calculus is listed as an elective course, but this dependency means that it is actually required.

**Duration:**
Jan 23, 20201

**Background:**
For an excellent writeup of how the Math curriculum arrived at its current state, I direct readers to here:
https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/768#issuecomment-672637354

In short, our curricular guidelines do not require calculus, but do require a college level math course that enables students to build mathematical maturity. As such calculus is offered as one of 4 math options. Our curricular guidelines _do_ require discrete math, which we meet with MIT's Math for CS. But MIT's Math for CS lists calculus as a prerequisite.

This tension has been pointed out before. There have since been users on Github and in Discord that ask whether calculus is actually elective. Also when the math requirements were reduced, there were [calls to make Calculus required](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/637). This ambiguity needlessly confuses learners.

**Proposal:**
List Calculus as required and move Math Electives to Advanced.

250,2020-12-18T18:30:43Z,https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/838,Request for Comment: Replace edX Calculus sequence with MIT OCW,"**Background:**

I'm currently finishing up MIT's Calculus 1B course on edX and I've found it not to be particularly well set up to teach students calculus. It's unclear to me who the intended audience is for the course, since it doesn't seem at all to be geared toward students new to calculus; many of the video lectures are short and lack context for the discussion of each new concept.  The video lectures are akin to someone slowly reading out of a textbook, and little effort is made to anticipate issues students might have and to provide elaboration and encourage understanding. 

Oddly enough, another course from MIT (with some of the same content) does significantly more to pedagogically engage with students, is less discouraging for newcomers to calculus, and is, I think, better in terms of instruction.

**Advantages of OCW over edX:**

**1.** EdX cuts many of the recitation videos, which were among the most helpful bits of the OCW course. The two (student?) instructors take time to walk the viewer through each step of a problem, and they help to fill in any gaps you may have had after watching just the lectures. 

**2.** EdX cuts much of the lecture content of OCW and replaces it with their own shorter lectures. I found the OCW lectures more helpful to a student like me who had not studied calculus before. The edX lectures move quicker and explain less. Additionally, the OCW lectures are videos of actual classes, so they are occasionally punctuated by students asking for clarifications about things that I myself wished I could ask about. 

**3.** OCW has a massive problem bank with answers to all of the hundreds of problems offered there. OCW assigns selective problems for you to work on, but if you need more practice, the extra problems are there for you. No such extra practice exists in the edX class. 

**4.** OCW provides free exams with solutions; edX's exams are behind a paywall

**5.** OCW is available year-round, while edX is only available in cohorts.  You cannot, for example, start the course sequence at any time; you must wait for it to open.  Right now, for example, you cannot start Calculus 1A and there is no date set for when it will be available.


**Advantages of edX over OCW:**

**1.**  edX focuses on more challenging problems.  

Assuming a student is prepared for such problems, they will learn more by completing them.  To give an example of how difficult the problems are, though, in my Calculus 1A session, there were strings of comments about how difficult a particular unit was, and they were being posted by commenters who clearly already knew calculus (and much more) quite well, by their own admission. If even these commenters were finding trouble with a whole unit's worth of problems, I was left wondering who the course was designed for? It seems not to have been designed for someone learning the material for the first time.

**2.** edX focuses more heavily on applications of calculus to other fields of study.  Again, if prepared for the content, students will learn more about how calculus is used in the real world.  Unfortunately, I do not believe edX adequately prepares learners to engage with its physics/probability content.

**3.** edX has a comments section which is frequented by the instructors. This definitely **is**, without qualification, an advantage that edX has.  The instructors are very knowledgeable, kind, and helpful.  That said, the tutors and other students on the OSSU Discord also seem to have these same qualities and would perhaps provide a suitable substitute for this feature.


**Comments made by other students on edX**

Here is a selection of comments from the end of unit 3 of the current session of Calculus 1B; many students here were leaving comments similar to my sentiments above.  Admittedly, some other students also commented on how much they loved the course, but to my eyes these comments were limited to learners who were returning to math after some absence and trying to brush up their skills, not posted so much by students actually learning the material.

""Original MITOCW lectures have saved me. Edx materials are well constructed, but they are like patchwork, and I lost coherency. Edx way must be good for learners having knowledge, they can get information efficiently, but for me, it did not work. Then I found original lectures, and wow! Original lectures are theoretical and consistent, telling me where I am. Important thing is, original lectures have contexts! Contexts are very important for me to construct things. Only essence like edx is not enough.""

""the gap between the exercises (which are already harder than what you would see in a typical calculus course) and the problem sets is so large as to be demoralizing even for a student with good math skills and a strong work ethic like myself. Maybe if I were at university taking physics and other technical courses in conjunction with this it would be a different story. I don't know.""

""I'm doing fine at the regular class exercises, but when it comes to the Problem Sets, I've been consistently whacked. I think I read somewhere that people usually study from 5 to 10 hours a week for MITx Calculus programs, but for this last Problem Set I've been doing at least 3 hours a day. I almost gave up the course while doing this Problem Set 3A!""

""Try watching the lectures only in the OpenCourseware series, then memorize the basic concepts so they can be recalled immediately. At the end of the day I listen to these lectures only, they are more concise and accessible in OpenCourseware.""

""I agree with watching the OCW videos that are very sequential.""


**Proposal:**

For OSSU's calculus requirement, replace the edX Calculus sequence with MIT's OCW

253,2020-12-04T22:17:16Z,https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/833,Request for Comment: Remove CS50 from Core Systems,"**Problem:**
CS50 is a time consuming course that does not match the learning goals of Core Systems.

**Duration:**
Jan 1, 2020

**Background:**
CS50 is currently in the curriculum ""because it is one of the few chances the student has to play with manual memory management in a (relatively) low-level language. By learning C, students will also have a much easier time getting through the following course, Nand2Tetris."" [FAQ](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/master/FAQ.md#why-do-you-recommend-skipping-the-second-half-of-cs50)

However, C pointers and memory management (malloc, etc) are elective topics in the Programming Languages knowledge area in our curriculum guidelines. [CS2013](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/education/cs2013_web_final.pdf#page=165)

The authors of Nand2Tetris do not list C or understanding of manual memory as a prerequisite. ""The course and the book are completely self-contained, requiring only programming (in any language) as a pre-requisite."" [Nand2Tetris About Page](https://www.nand2tetris.org/copy-of-cool-stuff)

Meanwhile, CS50 is one of the most time consuming courses in the curriculum, with an upper bound estimate of 240 hours for completion. [Timeline Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bkUU90y4rKYQHwY5AR2iX6iiPTrPEsYs75GkCAkrgm4/edit#gid=0) While OSSU encourages students to stop the course after the section on C, in practice many students continue in the course. If a student is devoting ~20 hours per week to study, removing CS50 from the curriculum will move up the student's completion date by 1 to 3 months. Given that the overall time commitment is ~24 months, this means removing the CS 50 recommendation can reduce a student's time to completion by about 10%.

**Proposal:**
Remove CS50 from Core Systems.

**Alternatives:**
Replace CS50 with a course more targeted to learning C pointers and memory management:
- I have long hoped to work with the author of [Aalto University's course on C](https://moocfi.github.io/courses/2016/aalto-c/en/) to get the autograder back online.
- Alternatively, we could recommend [Learn-c.org's](https://www.learn-c.org/en/Welcome) Advanced track
- Or [LearnCpp.com's](https://www.learncpp.com/) Chapter P.

**Note:**
This RFC is not a forum for discussing CS50's strengths as an intro to programming course. That is not the role it serves in the OSSU curriculum. Arguments for its retention should focus on whether it appropriately fills its roll as a mid-curriculum course.",2021-01-03T02:47:45Z,833,,,,[]
254,2020-12-01T04:19:05Z,https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/832,Request for Comment: Switch some courses from OCW/edX to OLL,"**Background:**

MIT relatively recently started a third platform for their materials called Open Learning Library (OLL). It looks like edX, but it's completely free and always available like ocw. The courses in OSSU that are available in OLL are:

* 18.01 Single Variable Calculus
* 18.06 Linear Algebra
* 6.042J Mathematics for Computer Science

I took a cursory look and here were my findings:

[Single Variable Calculus](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITx+18.01.1x+2T2019/about): has the unit 0 on limits from edX, but has lots of references to edX and skips homework a, homework b, and the final exam. I did not look at Calculus [1B](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITx+18.01.2x+3T2019/about) and [1C](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITx+18.01.3x+1T2020/about) because I am lazy.

[Linear Algebra](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:OCW+18.06SC+2T2019/about): makes you click more without providing more value

[Math for CS](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:OCW+6.042J+2T2019/about): interleaves the materials so you don't have to keep looking at the resource index and bouncing between different parts of the site

**Proposal:**

* Make the ocw link to Math for CS an alt link with the OLL link as the primary link.
* Make OLL alt links for Single Variable Calculus. Maybe even make OLL the primary since edX does not follow the run regularly rule of OSSU only running once or twice a year?

This course in Advanced Theory covers (almost entirely) topics not mentioned in the [CS 2013 curriculum guidelines](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/education/cs2013_web_final.pdf).

**Duration:**

November 12, 2020 - December 12, 2020

**Background:**

I finished this course. I wrote a lengthy review [here](https://github.com/spamegg1/reviews/#concept).

**Proposal:**

Remove the course from the curriculum.

**Details:**

The course (while excellent) is a graduate level math course covering a specialized version of Lattice Theory. You can read more details in my review.

The only relevant topics covered in this course that are mentioned in the [CS 2013 curriculum guidelines](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/education/cs2013_web_final.pdf) are:
```
IM/Data Mining [Elective]: (page 118)
    Learning Outcomes 4.
        Describe how to extend a relational system to find patterns using association rules.
        Identify and characterize sources of noise, redundancy, and outliers in presented data.
```
However this topic is mentioned only briefly in the second half of the last week (out of 6 weeks), at the very end of the course. The rest 5 1/2 weeks of the course are not relevant to [CS 2013](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/education/cs2013_web_final.pdf).",2020-12-11T18:18:19Z,818,,,,[]

277,2020-09-18T17:13:28Z,https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/793,OSSU Partnership Statement,"Dear Mr. John Hanson alias ""hanjiexi"",

This is a response in reference to the post you made several days ago. As you have made some defamatory remarks against our institution which has partnered with the OSSU, we shall answer the charges you have indirectly attacked us with on the advise of our lawyers and solicitors. 

For the reference of the public, this is the comment made by the above mentioned person which we have screen captured in the event that the said statement will be deleted.

https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/784#issuecomment-693727969 

In June of this year and with proper email trail entered as evidence of the foregoing, we contacted the founder and creator of the OSSU programme, Mr. Eric Douglas, to request for his permission and legal consent to establish a partnership with the OSSU. Mr. Douglas, being the said owner and creator of this programme gave his authorisation to help provide opportunity for students who take the courses listed in the OSSU curriculum to be eventually recognised for their own achievements with a degree granted by our institution.

Our Institution, the Asia Caribbean Open Institute, is an educational advocacy initiative of the Caribbean ASEAN Council. It is  a non-traditional online school established in response to one of our objectives of supporting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal on Education or Goal No. 4 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

As an international non-governmental organisation working with various governments and non-state actors, the Caribbean ASEAN Council is duly registered under the laws of Switzerland with a coordinating representative for the United Nations Office at Geneva. We have representatives in Europe, Southeast Asia, and the Caribbean. The Council Secretariat which also performs the duties of Registrar for the Institute is the Eastern Caribbean-Southeast Asia Chamber which itself, is a non-government organisation registered in England and Wales. Our organisation is recognised by the United Nations Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States. We have registered with the NGO Branch of the United Nations Economic and Social Council and with the Transparency Register of the European Parliament and the EU Commission. We are a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact and an Associate Member of the Conference of NGOs in Consultative Relationship with the United Nations. I can go on about proving the legitimacy of our organisation but that would take much space so in the interest of this statement, I shall move forward and request readers to visit our websites for more information.

The objective of the Asia Caribbean Open Institute is to provide accessible and affordable education to students from developing countries. We primarily serve students in Southeast Asia as well as less developed countries in the Caribbean such as Haiti. The Institute does not directly develop its own courses but instead works with various educational providers that are engaged in Open CourseWare (OCW), Open Educational Resources (OER), and Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) to be able to provide a platform for our students who cannot afford to enroll in money making colleges and universities. Hence, the partnership with the OSSU.

You mentioned in your post and I quote:

_""As an example of a threat, recently we were contacted by an organization that appears to be a diploma mill and may be committing fraud. On a few days notice, and without permission from the board, this organisation created a website asking students to pay them for a degree in partnership with Open Source Society University.""_

Dear sir, if you thoroughly read our website, all the legal information contained therein with due reference and links to all the government agencies are present. Swiss law specifically allows our Institute to issue degrees related to the courses we offer without the need for any sort of accreditation. We can provide you with a list of educational providers in Switzerland to support this fact. On top of this, our Registrar has registered with the United Kingdom Register of Learning Providers to comply with the requirements in the United Kingdom and Commonwealth countries. Our Institute does not issue degrees without actual coursework done by the student and it is very clear to our students that each programme they enroll in will take much more than a swipe of a credit card to finish. We can provide student references upon legal request. Similar to the University of the People, our Institute has no tuition fees and our programmes cost only a few hundred Euros in total from enrollment to graduation! That is much less than the cost of a computer, laptop, tablet or mobile phone that most people have in the North America and Europe. Also, for your information, all of our currently enrolled students are on a 100% scholarship and have not paid a single cent thanks to our supporting partners.  

Our advocacy was developed and implemented with poor people from poor countries in mind! Calling our institution a ""diploma mill"" and a ""fraud"" is an insult to myself and every other person in our organisation who have tirelessly worked on establishing it where it is today. Not to mention, our students who rely on open educational resources to have a brighter future. Unfortunately, not everyone in the world is as fortunate as you and the others in this online community.

Furthermore, I wish to reiterate that in the email conversation with Mr. Douglas, there was no mention of any other needed approval as we were granted the explicit consent of the owner and creator of the aforementioned OSSU programme. Mr. Waciuma Wanjohi was also part of this email conversation and he did not inform us either of any such requirement.

In reference to the foregoing facts, it is our belief that whatever personal issues you may have with Mr. Douglas is beyond our original agreement with him. As far as our organisation is concerned, we have fully respected international copyright laws owned by Mr. Douglas as the creator and owner of the OSSU Computer Science programme. Whatever development in the management of this open source community has transpired, only Mr. Douglas has the sole right to cancel the said agreement he has conferred upon our institution as the original accord also lies with him.

We must also vehemently remind you not to slander our institution further or risk legal prosecution to the full extent of the laws of your country and international laws related thereto.

This statement is for the information of the general public and shall be filed with attached evidence by our legal representative to the Cyber Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Yours faithfully,

I don't support this idea of replacing the Future Learn course with the Khan Academy one and this issue makes a case for restoring the FutureLearn precalculus course. 

I believe the reasoning for this change was 'consistency' with other Khan Academy courses recommended in the curriculum. There is also an issue that FutureLearn charges for certificates and exams. Whilst this is true, Khan academy has neither of these features i.e. neither it has an exam nor provides a certificate. So, this comparison is moot.

In fact, apart from the videos, there is no testing of the concepts learned whatsoever. FutureLearn is actually superior in this regard, because it actually allows students to attempt multiple-choice type quizzes for which answers and detailed explanations are given by the instructors. Khan academy does not provide any feedback or quizzes or facilitate student interaction whatsoever. It can turn into a purely passive video watching session rather than an active engagement. I am currently taking FutureLearn's pre-algebra and can vouch for its high quality. The high ratings on ClassCentral for the FutureLearn course is an independent testimony to its quality.

In the absence of a clear-cut comparison of technical & pedagogical merits of the two courses, I am proposing to bring back FutureLearn Pre-calculus.",2020-12-01T11:46:17Z,789,,,,[]
281,2020-09-16T05:29:50Z,https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/pull/788,Changed Py4E hours of effort to match OSSU expected weekly effort levels,"A frequent complaint of our introductory course Python For Everyone (Py4E) is that our projected level of effort claims it takes 34 weeks to complete this course. There has been recent discussion indicating that an 8-month introductory course may be too ambitious for the OSSU program (including on the Discord channel and #785.) Meanwhile, many students on the Discord report being able to complete Py4E in substantially shorter time periods by increasing the amount of effort.

The 34 week course duration is estimated from an assumed 3 hours of effort per week. Other courses in the OSSU program assume 8-12 hours of effort per week. 

**Problem:** Assigning 3 hours of effort per week for our Py4E course is artificially inflating the perceived length of the course.

**Complication:** The course is truly self-paced, and progress can be made with as little as 3 hours of effort per week - should the student so choose.

**Proposed Solution:** Adjust the advertised level of effort to a nominal 10 weeks at a nominal 10 hours of effort per week, to put this course on parity with the introductory courses that follow it. Provide additional notation to clarify that the course is self-paced and the required level of effort can be adjusted to meet the student's needs.",2020-09-16T06:12:23Z,788,"{'url': 'https://api.github.com/repos/ossu/computer-science/pulls/788', 'html_url': 'https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/pull/788', 'diff_url': 'https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/pull/788.diff', 'patch_url': 'https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/pull/788.patch', 'merged_at': '2020-09-16T06:12:22Z'}",,,[]

The Missing Semester is a challenging course early in the curriculum.
 
**Duration**:
2020-09-10
 
**Background**:
The Missing Semester is meant to teach students how to use a number of tools of computer science. These include the terminal, git, and vim.

However, numerous students have given feedback that the assignments are quite challenging. Examples can be found in [this issue](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/715). The course also occurs quite early in the curriculum.

In addition, the courses immediately after this one do not leverage the lessons learned. How to Code is taught entirely within Dr. Racket. Students will most benefit from exposure to command line environments before studying operating systems and networks.

**Proposal**:
Move The Missing Semester immediately before Core Systems.

OSSU contributors spend time transcribing easily found information.
 
**Duration**:
Aug 30, 2020
 
**Background**:
On every course, OSSU contributors write the duration (number of weeks) and effort (number of hours per week) expected by the course.
For the vast majority of courses, this information is simply being transcribed from the front of the course page. In these cases, the information is duplicative and a waste.
In other cases, the duration/effort have not been estimated by the course platform/instructor. In these cases, such an estimate does add information. But it often takes a significant amount of time for OSSU contributors to settle on an estimate. This should only be undertaken if it provides value to students.
Does the inclusion of duration/effort aid students? It may not. The expectation is that students will proceed in linear fashion from first course to last. In this paradigm, what is the value of calculating an individual course’s duration?
 
**Proposal**:
- Remove Duration and Effort from all courses.

**Alternatives**:

1. Estimate duration and effort only for courses such as Missing Semester and Introduction to Computer Networking which do not offer estimates.
2. Keep the curriculum as it is.

Electricity and Magnetism are more than the prerequisite knowledge for the follow on courses on Computer Structures

**Duration**:
Aug 30, 2020

**Background**:
There have been [questions in the past](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/668#issuecomment-599241388) about the appropriateness of the Electricity and Magnetism courses (E&M1 and E&M2).
These courses do not cover curriculum in the CS2013 (either core or elective). As such their only justification for inclusion in the curriculum would be as a prerequisite. The courses are currently listed in OSSU’s curriculum as prerequisites for Computation Structures 1: Digital Circuits.
But Computation Structures 1: Digital Circuits on Coursera details the following as the prereqs:
A working knowledge of electrical fundamentals (voltages, currents, simple components) or [CornellX ENGRI1210x: The Computing Technology Inside Your Smartphone](https://www.edx.org/course/the-computing-technology-inside-your-smartphone).
E&M2 course in particular goes far beyond voltages, currents, simple components, teaching, “magnetic field, how it is created by currents and magnetic materials, induction and inductors, and AC circuits.”

**Proposal**:
- Remove E&M1 and E&M2.
- Add [The Computing Technology Inside Your Smartphone](https://www.edx.org/course/the-computing-technology-inside-your-smartphone).

**Alternatives**:

1. Remove E&M1 and E&M2. In the pre-req section of Computation Structures 1 write _A working knowledge of electrical fundamentals (voltages, currents, simple components) or [CornellX ENGRI1210x: The Computing Technology Inside Your Smartphone](https://www.edx.org/course/the-computing-technology-inside-your-smartphone)_.
2. Keep E&M1, while dropping E&M2. From the course description E&M1 “serves as an introduction to charge, the electric field, the electric potential, current, resistance, and DC circuits with resistors and capacitors.”

303,2020-08-02T07:51:00Z,https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/763,RFC: Standardize Intro to Programming,"**Problem**:
Intro to Programming is different in format and approach from the other sections of OSSU.

**Duration**:
Aug 15, 2020

**Background**:
The Intro to Programming (hereafter referred to as ITP) courses were added after acceptance of this [RFC](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/589). At the time, I hypothesized that giving students choice about the intro course would lower the debate about intro courses. My personal assessment is that this has been moderately successful. At the same time, this structure has come with downsides:
1. By giving students choice between two entry points, some students join the Gitter to ask which they should take. This has happened about a half dozen times since the adding ITP.
2. Some students have taken both of the ITP course options. This is not desirable, OSSU wants students to advance in the curriculum, and does not recommend taking excessive intro classes.

The two options were both Coursera specializations. Rather than link to the individual courses, there was a single link to the specialization. This led to issues:
1. Because individual Coursera courses can be audited, but entire specializations, students regularly ask in the Gitter about the need to pay.
2. Students have not been clear if the time estimates are for the whole specialization or just the first course in the specialization, as demonstrated in this [issue](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/759).

One of the courses, Python for Everybody (Py4E) has a freely available course site from the course creator. OSSU now recommends students use that site.

While the two options are meant for absolute beginners, they go to very different depths. Fundamentals of Computing (FoC) takes twice as long as Py4E. In this extra time, FoC covers more material. This leads to issues:
1. Students are meant to take different courses following their intro, depending on which path they chose. After FoC, students should take Missing Semester. After Py4E students should take Introduction to Computer Science and Programming using Python.
2. It’s not clear that all of the material in FoC is appropriate for students new to programming. In a recent [issue](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/759#issuecomment-666249721), a contributor (@spamegg1) noted that FoC goes quite deep into algorithmic complexity, which goes beyond the goals of an Introduction to Programming, or even an Introduction to Computer Science.
3. The advanced material in FoC is covered later in other OSSU courses.

It should be noted, there have been no complaints about either course. There have been a number of students who have praised (Py4E). When students have asked for recommendations of which course to take, there have been contributors that recommend Py4E and others that recommend (FoC).

**Proposal**:
To simplify the Intro to Programming section, OSSU should recommend only Python for Everybody. Doing so will address the above issues. There is no expected degradation of the curriculum, as Py4E is already a recommended course.

**Alternatives**:

1. Rather than recommending just Py4E, OSSU could recommend only FoC. This does not seem appropriate because of the questions about FoC’s depth.

2. Keep the curriculum as it is.

I'm developing a free open source online platform/course for complete beginners to teach themselves coding in Python. See the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/alexmojaki/futurecoder) for more information or try out the [demo here](https://futurecoder.herokuapp.com/).

It's looking pretty good so far, and when it's ready I'm confident that it can be extremely helpful to anyone learning how to code. I've added some awesome features that no other online courses have, and there's more to come. However, it's a big project and I'd be foolish to try and do the whole thing on my own. ""If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.""

I'm posting this here because I'm looking for people who might be interested in contributing, either for coding the platform or for writing course content. I imagine that a community of people invested in open source education is a good place to ask. I hope me asking here is OK, the gitter channel didn't look right and I couldn't see any other alternative.

[Software Engineering: Introduction](https://www.edx.org/course/software-engineering-introduction-ubcx-softeng1x) (SEI) and [Software Development Capstone Project](https://www.edx.org/course/software-development-capstone-project-ubcx-softengprjx) (SDCP) are mostly behind a paywall and are very poorly reviewed/supported.

Duration:
August 20, 2020

Proposal:
Replace them with [Fullstack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en) (FSOpen).

Alternative:
Replace them with [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/)'s second half, [Web Track](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/tracks/web/), and its [final project](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/project/) (preferably a web project).

Background:
I had many people ask me whether I took these two courses.
DISCLAIMER: I DID NOT FINISH these courses. (As far as I can tell, very few people did.) So I would love to hear your thoughts.

However I enrolled in both and browsed through the content, watched the videos, downloaded and looked at the source code.

I was neither able to even see any quizzes or exams in SEI because they were all behind paywalls, nor to attempt programming assignments in SDCP (I remember SDCP saying ""audit learners can only submit once every 60 hours"" but also saying ""graded assessments are paid only!""). Then I quickly lost access to SEI. I even made a second edX account with a second email and enrolled, but eventually I lost access to that enrollment as well. 

The main point of contention comes from [a very detailed review](https://www.classcentral.com/course/edx-software-development-capstone-project-8198) from one of two poor (as in pain, not money) students who endured these courses for months and even paid money for them. One of them is a very long review, and it touches upon the rest of the UBC Micromasters program too, but please read it.

It is not logical to rely on two very negative reviews. So I looked for some [positive](https://www.classcentral.com/course/edx-software-engineering-introduction-8205) [reviews](https://www.coursetalk.com/providers/edx/courses/software-engineering-introduction) too (which were not very helpful), and combined it with my own experience. Also I went out of my way to take another class to learn the same subject from a highly acclaimed resource and make a healthier comparison. 

There are actually a few points where SEI + SDCP is better, or offers something FSOpen does not. Overall I think FSOpen is VASTLY superior.



Details:

Comparison of SEI + SDCP and FSOpen:

SEI + SDCP | FSOpen
:-- | --: 
U of British Columbia | U of Helsinki (well known for high quality CS courses) 
SEI very briefly teaches software methodologies: Agile, Sprint, Waterfall, how to write requirements/specification etc. | Does not cover software methodologies (can be covered easily with some reading, also covered by Software Architecture and Design in Advanced Programming) 
Videos (of high production quality, but of dubious value, and some irrelevant/untested by instructor's own admission) | No videos, but extremely comprehensive text, with tons of references to industry authorities and standards 
Does not teach the languages/tools used: Typescript, Node, Webpack. Must learn yourself|Teaches EVERYTHING, line by line, from scratch. Nothing assumed
Test/grader code is hidden|All code is fully open source
No solutions|Full solutions provided
SDCP has very difficult assignments, many students stuck. Requires teammates.|Simpler, easier exercises in smaller chunks that still teach all the skills. Can be completed solo.
Teaches object-oriented design patterns in Javascript | No OOP-style JS, but many other programming/design patterns taught (functional JS, avoiding mutating state directly) 
Running example code in SEI (web Mario game) provided ""as-is"" | Running example code is constantly updated after adding code in each section, with each evolution of the code available for download in different branches 
Significant time limitation on edX platform if you don't pay | No time limit, self-paced
All assignments, quizzes, exams behind paywalls. Even if you pay, no feedback for wrong answers on multiple choice questions|No quizzes, exams or graded assignments (but tons of programming exercises), instead it is project-based, do-it-yourself, free-open style learning
Not updated (last commit 3 years ago), abandoned by its instructors even for paid learners. Tons of unanswered questions in discussion boards|Updated yearly to catch up with all recent changes in web development, best practices; active repositories (last commit just a few months ago)
SEI teaches old style asynchronous callbacks, which leads to ""callback hell"". Must learn Async Promises yourself for SDCP (some dead links). |Teaches the new standard of ""promise-based"" callbacks, promise-chaining, async/await pattern
Does not teach latest tools/libs, You have to figure it all out yourself through searches, Stackoverflow etc.|Teaches many modern popular tools/libs: React, Express, Node, MongoDB, Heroku, Mongoose, ESLint, Axios, Typescript, Webpack, many popular Middleware libraries
Must pay to get code graded. No free certificate. Some promise of ""Career Development Program"" if you pay|Free certificate without any grading, Free U of Helsinki credit for people w/ Finnish social security number, chance to job interview with startup companies
Automated testing through Mocha and Chai|Teaches to write own tests in Mocha, mongo-mock. Also teaches testing React apps with Jest, and end-to-end testing with Cypress.io
Backend uses CSV and XML data with queries in Extended Backus-Naur form (a fairly complicated schema) |Backend focuses mostly on JSON data with queries in NoSQL variants like MongoDB (more modern)
Spends all of second course to make a RESTful frontend, backend, database query app. Very simple frontend |The same is accomplished by the end of Part 3 (of 9), then goes into much more detail and advanced modern topics (GraphQL, Redux, Typescript, custom React hooks etc.) By the end, 5-6 simple working web apps and 1-2 complex, very modern apps with custom hooks and CSS styling

Is it okay to skip all 'Intro CS' courses and jump directly to 'Core CS'?

I already know that I want to learn computer science and, as a professional developer since 2013, I have some programming experience. Are these courses only for beginners who want to try a new area to see if they like it or do these courses have some knowledge that I will not see in Core CS courses?

On behalf of the Asia Caribbean Open Institute, I hope this finds you safe and well during this challenging time.

With sincerest thanks to OSSU Founder, Mr. Eric Douglas @ericdouglas, we wish to inform to you that we are working towards making the OSSU Computer Science project into a Bachelor's degree that will be made available to underprivileged students from developing countries across the globe. 

Our distance learning online Institute was built on the ideals set by U.N. Sustainable Development Goal No. 4 which aims to ""ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all"". The Institute is an advocacy initiative of the Caribbean ASEAN Council, an international socio-civic, non-government and non-profit organization established in Switzerland. Our registrar and academic representative, the Eastern Caribbean-Southeast Asia Chamber, is an NGO registered with the UK Register of Learning Providers. We strongly believe that education should be free and not only available to those who can afford it.

The Institute already offers Business programmes and awards Swiss degrees and diplomas. We will be including the OSSU Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSc-CS) as our latest programme. Just to be transparent, there is no intention to reinvent the wheel, change the effective OSSU curriculum or interrupt the affairs of the OSSU community. Our objective is to provide an opportunity for graduates of the OSSU CS programme to be competitive in the labour market by being able to present a degree certificate from our Institute.

We are ironing out details with our legal advisors in Geneva and London and will hopefully roll out the programme in the next few days. Rest assured, as part of our commitment to Mr. Douglas, we will make sure that current OSSU students and those that have finished the OSSU CS curriculum (with uploaded peer reviewed projects) can take advantage of this new development.

To learn more about our Institute, please visit http://www.asiacaribbean.institute

Thank you and we look forward to your support.

With kind regards,

328,2020-06-20T06:18:52Z,https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/735,RFC: Intro to Parallel Programming,"Problem:

This course in Advanced Programming has many issues. 

Duration:

July 20, 2020

Background:

I wrote a lengthy review of Intro to Parallel Programming [here](https://github.com/spamegg1/reviews/#cs344). Please read it. Here are some of the issues:

- It's deprecated and abandoned/not supported (not possible to find through Udacity's course catalog unless you know the specific link or find it through search engines). 
- The discussion forums are dead (links in the course don't work, you have to find it through search engines). Inactive and full of outdated information.
- Its autograders do not work (the backend which used to compile and run code on Amazon's GPU timesharing is gone).  
- Many other alternatives for compiling and running its code do not work. The only working alternative (Google Colab Notebooks) is missing the final exam, and is still very uninformative/difficult to debug without help or looking at solutions online. 
- The code is very difficult to write and debug without any help. Even one pixel being slightly off makes it fail, and impossible to understand why. 
- The assignments are quite difficult, and involve low-level memory allocation/pointer arithmetic/type conversions in C++ which introduce very subtle bugs.
- Too much time is focused on nitty gritty details of extremely GPU-specific issues.

Proposal:

Replace this course with [Parallel Programming](https://www.coursera.org/learn/parprog1/). Move this course to Extras.

I took [this course too](https://github.com/spamegg1/reviews/#scala). Here is my justification:

I have read through the CS 2013 document's Parallel and Distributed Programming section starting on page 148. This new course would cover all the same Knowledge Areas as Intro to Parallel Programming, except the SMP, SIMD and GPU subheadings under PD/Parallel Architecture. (Neither course covers Cloud Distributed Programming, that's covered by the next course in the Scala Specialization.) This course would cover the additional topics of Task Parallelism vs. Data Parallelism, and data-parallel data structures, which are not covered in the other course. Data-parallel data structures are especially very important for real-world applications, whereas in CUDA C++ we just use good old arrays.

This course has fully working auto-graders with tests and meaningful debug messages, and programming assignments that cover almost the same parallel topics (in fact 2 of the programming assignments are exactly the same as the other course! Blur filter and parallel reduce/scan) except for not being GPU-specific. The assignments are much easier, and have interactive GUIs that show the image blurring/filtering directly!

The only issue I can see is that this new course necessitates Scala (which is not covered in Core CS, but is extremely similar to ML which is covered in Programming Languages Part A). Thankfully the instructors created a [repository](https://github.com/axel22/parprog-snippets) for lecture code snippets. For a student who reached Advanced Programming, it should not be an issue to pick up Scala and learn it very quickly; it is much easier than C++. Despite being the 3rd course in a  5-course Specialization, it does not depend on the first two in any specific ways, except for being familiar with the language.

Alternative:

Keep the course as it is. As long as the Google Colab Notebooks are still up for the Homeworks, it's technically doable but extremely difficult and painful.",2020-07-17T08:04:20Z,735,,,,[]

[Proof of completion](https://github.com/spamegg1/ScalaCapstone/blob/master/spec.png) (you have to scroll sideways a bit)

Originally written: Tuesday, June 9, 2020

[Course-by-course review](https://github.com/spamegg1/reviews/) (**FINISHED!**)

Took 2 years (late May 2018 - early June 2020)

My significant advantages:
- used to teach college math. So I skipped math classes
  (there used to be A LOT MORE math in the curriculum, some of you might remember!)
- worked on OSSU full time

Disadvantages:
- easily demotivated, difficulty feeling rewarded

I am Strongly biased towards math and functional programming, biased against object oriented programming. I learn by doing, I dislike long lectures/concepts/info dumps.

What happened in 2 years?
- two deaths in the family
- got demotivated and ""quit"" twice: once for 3 weeks, once for around 2-3 months
- lots of stress from economic/political/war stuff that happened where I live. Had a few panic attacks! Financially OK (quit stock market early enough to avoid losses)
- hardware problems:
GPU broke right when I was taking CUDA programming. The irony!
Burnt motherboard's CPU socket from too long parallel execution. CPU is fine though!
- COVID-19 (right at the end, during my Spec. Quarantine took a psychological toll on me. Also good luck finding hardware in a pandemic!)
- Lost much weight, built a little muscle

Courses I took, roughly in this order:
- CS50
- How to Code 1,2
- PLABC
- Learn Prolog Now!
- Haskell from First Principles
- Nand2Tetris 1,2
- Intro to Networking
- [Hack the Kernel](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/690)
- Intro to CS and Programming using Python
- Core Theory
- Databases (Stanford)
- Computer Graphics (skipped last assignment)
- Machine Learning
- Compilers (from Udacity)
- Software Debugging
- Software Testing
- Software Architecture & Design
- LAFF - On programming for correctness
- Intro to Parallel Programming (very hard!)
- Functional Programming in Scala (5 courses, free to audit the whole thing!)

Courses I took that are NO LONGER on the curriculum:
- Software Construction 1,2
- Cryptography 1 (very hard MATH course)

Courses I took that are NOT on the curriculum:
- CS50's second half and its [final project](https://number-python.herokuapp.com/)
- Software Processes (from [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/software-processes))
- Software Architecture (from [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/software-architecture))
- Functional Programming in Haskell (from [FutureLearn](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/functional-programming-haskell))
- Design of Computer Programs (Udacity CS212)

Courses I did NOT take that ARE on the curriculum:
- Software Engineering Intro/Capstone
- The Security courses that were added recently

Things I wish I knew / I wish somebody told me before:
- difference between Computer Science and Programming. Apparently it's huge! I was more interested in Programming since I have theory from my math background. Ironically it turns out I don't like Programming that much. Much prefer CS, especially algorithms.
- How to create a ""learning lifestyle"" and stay motivated, feel rewarded.
Those ""Mindshift"" classes buried at the bottom of EXTRAS should be the first thing we are required to take!

The ""shining core"" of OSSU
- CS50, PLABC, N2T, Core Theory and Machine Learning.

Best Courses:
- Core Theory (Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm with Union by Rank and Path Compression and its running time analysis with the Inverse Ackermann function are so beautiful, I had tears in my eyes!)
- Nand 2 Tetris (makes you feel like you can do ANYTHING)

Most useful courses: Core Theory and PLABC (by far)

Takeaways:
- Be very clear about your goals and expectations from the beginning. OSSU might not give you what you expect!
- If you only ""kinda"" like CS/programming, it looks ""cool"", but you don't ""love"" it, it's gonna be hard. Maybe reconsider? Or do only as much as interests you? Put things into a [long term perspective](https://www.norvig.com/21-days.html).
- Specializations are no big deal. Like ""normal"" courses. By far the most useful to prepare me for the Spec were PLABC and the [Haskell book](https://haskellbook.com). The rest were not relevant. I could have EASILY taken the Spec after those (I had not even taken Core Theory at that point).
- Don't pay! Not even for Specializations. They offer very little support and some stuff is outdated. Not worth the money.
- Sometimes I focused way too much on finishing a course as quickly as possible and getting it out of the way, moving on to the next. I did not learn too well. When confronted with courses that were not very good / that I did not enjoy, my motivation would switch from learning to ""getting it over with"", forcing my way through. Don't do this! Better to skip such courses entirely.
- Physical exercise is extremely important to stay consistent and motivated.
- I pushed my ""challenge yourself"" thing a bit too far I think. At the same time I started OSSU I also started lifting weights and intermittent fasting. You should adjust things so that what you're doing feels A LITTLE challenging but does not overwhelm you.

What now?
- I feel very burnt out. Don't want to see a single line of code for a while! Not even clever functional one-liners that magically process gigabytes of data.
- I want to do some fun stuff later. I'll take CS50's intro to Game Development, then maybe audit the Game Specialization.
- My goal was not to get a job (although a low-key part-time remote job would be nice), but to challenge myself. MISSION ACCOMPLISHED! By a lot.
- My original goal was to take all of Advanced Programming. I'll do that at some point. Advanced Systems and Theory are left. Should take another 3 months or so.
- Eventually I should bite the bullet and stop avoiding the topics I disliked: web programming and Javascript. 
- Looked at Scala jobs, Functional jobs, Triplebyte, and some local jobs. All want ""senior"" devs with 5+ years experience and lots of other tech I don't know yet. I can only work remotely. So I gotta keep at it! In addition to Spark, I will look into learning other tools in the Scala sphere: Akka, Play, Scala.JS

The Most Difficult Thing:
- Reading an existing code base. Reading is extremely hard. This is probably why so much software goes unmaintained, rewritten and into the garbage.

Furthermore, @waciumawanjohi has opened a proposal to start using University of Helsinki's DB course.

However, the Lagunita course is apparently back! Or, to be more exact, will be back - it is in the process of being uploaded to edX. Currently, only 6 out of 14 courses are there, but on each course it's explicitly mentioned that ""As of April 2020 we are still adding courses to edX; we expect this process to be complete by early May 2020""! While it will apparently take a bit more time, as it is mid-May already, I expect that soon all 14 will be online!
 
So, I propose to just go back to Stanford's course, as it's quality has been proven. Here's the link to edX with the current 6 courses:

346,2020-05-14T07:41:07Z,https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/715,Update 'Missing Semester' info,"I just 'finished' the course. I've taken 14 or so OSSU classes and found this very helpful and wish I'd taken it earlier (especially the Vim chapter). The class is laid out and meant to be completed in 11 class days and 18 calendar days. I half-heartedly tried to keep up with their schedule (videos and exercises), and found it somewhat impractical. The videos take 45 mins - 1 hour, and the exercises vary in number and time required. Roughly 2 - 10 exercises some taking 5 minutes while others could take 2+ hours. 

From what I remember, the class assumes you're on Linux, so I often found I didn't have the programs installed (on Mac), which made some exercises take a lot longer (install time, install issues, etc). Also, lots of the exercises required some research to learn the tool / how to do the task which is good, but can take a lot of time depending on the task.

The two issues I see are:
 - we don't assume OSSU students are running linux
 - suggesting completion of all exercises is not what I think the class creators intended, and also is a potentially non-trivial distraction from continuing with the Core CS curriculum 

Some examples and thoughts from my experience:
 - Intro/Shell: not much to say (suggested exercises: 1 - 9)
 - Shell tools: not much to say (suggested exercises: 1 - 3)
 - Vim: I use Vim regularly, and thought this part was really great. That said, learning to use and customize Vim is an incremental process. New users would be not be helped by all the exercises because you need to use Vim regularly to become efficient and have perspective on what you'd like customized (suggested exercises: 1, 2, 4, 5)
 - Data wrangling: had lots of install systems with these exercises, and even problems with their specific Mac workaround suggestions (suggested exercises: 1, 2)
 - CLI: I'm on an old computer with limited memory, so I couldn't install any VMs (suggested exercises: possibly all of these)
 - Version control: git is similar to Vim as it's iterative learning (suggested exercises: 1, 2, 5)
 - Debugging and profiling: I had a lot of install issues here and didn't do any exercises, so I can't comment
 - Metaprogramming: I didn't quite have the context for this section to be that useful. It demystified 'make' a little bit, and can't comment on the exercises

After this I read / watched but stopped doing exercises.

Overall, I think at this point in the curriculum (2 - 3 basic programming classes), students won't quite have the context to understand a lot of this (I felt like I didn't when I took it). However, I definitely think it should stay at the current place. I think the purpose of this course should be to introduce students to these tools and serve as a reference, and I think the course designers intended that, too. I see three options rectify these problems: 

 1. Increase the duration / effort from 2 weeks at 12hrs/week to 3 weeks at 15+hrs/week (but tbh, the time required is unbounded if you complete all exercises because of OS/system problems possible with some tools). The problem with this is that I don't think this class is intended to be fully completed on first pass, and that it would be too large of a detour from Core CS.
 

 2. Add to the OSSU course description: 
""This class isn't meant to be fully completed. Watch all the videos (or read the notes), and only do the few exercises that seem interesting in each chapter. This class is meant to introduce you to topics so you know they exist and have a resource to learn if the need later arises. (link to some suggested exercises, and an explanation about possible install issues and what to do if you encounter them)""

I think this option sticks with what this class was set out to be - an introduction and a resource, but not an end in itself


 3. Move the course to later in Core CS. I don't think this is a good idea because students should be introduced to some of the topics ASAP (notably Vim and Git), and even later in Core CS, I don't think the problem of having context gets solved. I think the best way to get context for all of these tools is to build large, real world projects, which we don't do in Core CS

I often found I didn't have the programs installed, or that the exercise required me to do a bit of research to learn the tool. I'm on a Mac, and Linux might have more of these tools installed by default, but that's not something we can expect from students. Also, these are problems I'm running into after being an OSSU student for about 2 years. I wouldn't expect somebody just starting off working with computers / learning CS to be comfortable doing CLI stuff, and thus would likely take longer than me to do a lot of these tasks.

Two options:

364,2020-04-07T06:26:25Z,https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/693,Request for Comment: Replace Linear Algebra,"**Problem**:
The current Linear Algebra course focuses on efficient computer computation of matrices, rather than teaching students the theory and practice of linear algebra.

**Proposers**:
Alaharon123 and waciumawanjohi

**Duration**:
2020 May 4

**Background**:
Linear Algebra from Foundations to Frontiers (LAFF) has long been the recommended course for linear algebra. In 2017, we added the Essence of Linear Algebra because those videos so gracefully demonstrate the concepts within linear algebra. But even with this addition, LAFF remains a course focused intently on computation, slicing and dicing matrices as the professor would say. A good deal of time is spent reviewing how to get efficient computation of matrix operations out of an automated program. Rather than teaching efficient programming, OSSU is counting on the linear algebra course to teach concepts that students will leverage when studying machine learning or computer graphics.

An alternative comes from MIT. Gilbert Strang’s OCW Scholar course is put together with lectures, lecture notes, recitation videos, problem sets with solutions, and even optional references to a textbook. Strang teaches the material well, getting into the mindset of someone who doesn’t know the material and building up the student’s understanding. (Here is [an interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UJ4CFRGd-U) where he discusses exactly this approach).

Strang is well known in the math world. He wrote two of the three most read textbooks on Linear Algebra (using [number of goodreads reviews](https://www.goodreads.com/search?q=linear+algebra&qid=) as a proxy for number of individuals reading). He has [recorded multiple math courses](https://ocw.mit.edu/faculty/gilbert-strang/), including 4 on Linear Algebra. There was a recent [HackerNews discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22382337) of Strang’s lectures and textbooks, the thread features a number of testimonials.

**Proposal**:
Replace LAFF with MIT’s [Open Courseware Scholar Linear Algebra course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/).

**Alternatives**:
- Keep LAFF. LAFF has been a long feature of OSSU. Our endorsement was even mentioned by the professor in a letter to the course’s students. The course [still posts to social media](https://www.facebook.com/pg/LAFFutX/posts/), indicating that there is someone to hear feedback.
- Replace LAFF with an applied linear algebra class. There are three such courses:
  - Davidson's [Applications of Linear Algebra](https://www.edx.org/course/applications-of-linear-algebra-part-1)
  - Imperial College of London's [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning)
  - Harvard's [Introduction to Linear Models and Matrix Algebra](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-linear-models-and-matrix-algebra)
- There is a new (2019) [Linear Algebra](https://www.edx.org/course/linear-algebra-part-1-2) course from Rice. The lectures explain the material from the perspective of someone who already knows the material. It might be fine for a refresher, but is a poor match for OSSU students. More concerning, homework is behind a paywall, so there’s no way to actually practice it for free.

Hack The Kernel in Core Systems is poorly designed and supported, and is extremely difficult for its place in the curriculum.

Duration:
April 5, 2020 - May 5, 2020

Current State:
Awaiting feedback (updated Proposal and Alternatives with suggestions)

Proposer:
spamegg1

Proposal:
Replace Hack The Kernel with the textbook [OSTEP](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/) (Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces) and its [homework assignments](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/Homework/homework.html), supplemented by material from Wisconsin's [CS 537](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~shivaram/cs537-sp20/) and [its video](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGweYi6vcfHaTrkap3c1TPg/videos) [lectures](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBRYU9uye8e-ZuWQMPBAoYA/videos) which closely follows the textbook.

Alternatives:
Replace Hack The Kernel with Udacity's [UD923 Introduction to Operating Systems](https://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-operating-systems--ud923)

Details (very, very long):
I took Hack The Kernel. It was BY FAR the most difficult thing ever. It took me 6 months.

This course is poorly designed and supported. 

They recorded the university lectures with a camera in the back of the classroom and put them on the web. In most lecture videos you cannot see the projection screen because of light/glare, so you have to read the slides separately. Moreover the audio quality is low, so you cannot hear the questions the students are asking. 

I found the lectures to be very vague, unhelpful and underwhelming. The instructor has a tendency to give purely verbal explanations while walking back and forth in front of the classroom, instead of writing anything on the board or typing some code on the screen. There is no indication in the lectures how I am supposed to convert the high level abstract concepts in the lectures to the C programming API (the OSTEP book takes care of this with dedicated chapters). Also the lecture videos are very long and boring. (CS50 did not suffer from this, despite having even longer lecture videos.)

Recitation videos are a little bit more helpful but not by much. They had low audio quality and audio stutters. The TAs are trying VERY HARD ""not to give away any answers"" they end up talking in the same circles as the instructor; and also they deliberately avoid typing any code at all, instead giving vague hints. A few TAs gave some very helpful hints but again there is no info on how to convert them to C. Moreover the recitation videos are a collection of a bunch of videos, all from different years, where back in the past the assignments were somewhat different. No offence to the TAs, but some of them have very strong foreign accents and were difficult/impossible to understand with the low audio quality (I was a foreign TA in the US so I can sympathize).

The only helpful videos were the ones where the lecturer/TAs had ""screencasts"" of themselves typing stuff into the terminal, explaining how to setup the code system, how to browse the gigantic code base, using grep on the command line etc. But even these videos were hard to follow due to tiny font sizes and high resolution.

The slides for the course are also not helpful and very vague. The explanations of the concepts in slides don't really stick unless you read a textbook. The slides look like you took pages from a textbook and removed 90% of the text. I could not understand anything from them.

It looks like the course was not updated since 2017. The discussion forums were dead (last posts from 2017) so there is no way to get help. (This is not a unique problem, a lot of Udacity courses are also like this: outdated and ""abandoned"".) The assignment codes only work with a very outdated, insecure version of Ubuntu (Xenial 16.04 from 2016). The code had some bugs in it, which broke some of the assignment tests, with students reporting them all the way back to then. I was taking it in 2019.

There is no clear indication on the course website after which lecture/slide/recitation I should start each assignment. Also I did not know when I should watch each recitation video, because they were only listed under the pages of each assignment, rather than being incorporated into ""the course flow"". Students who physically attended this class at Harvard probably had no problem because they are on a schedule, but the creators did not translate this to the web version. Sometimes I ended up going too far in the course material/subjects and started the assignments too late. Sometimes I started the assignments too early without learning necessary concepts.

So at some point (way too late) I decided I should start ASST1. After watching all the related videos and reading all the related text, I had to stop taking the course because I could not get anywhere. Instead I dedicated one month to reading OSTEP (Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces) cover to cover and doing all of its homework. All of a sudden EVERYTHING MADE SENSE. This book is so good I cannot recommend it enough. It's like going to your favourite professor's office and hanging out with him/talking to him. In fact the book opens and closes each chapter with a Student/Professor dialogue.

Not only OSTEP explained everything at least 10 times better than the lecture/slides/recitations, it had CODE SEGMENTS that implemented the concepts in C. A programming course that shows you code! How evil indeed! Moreover it had dedicated chapters explaining the C Thread API and all its functions. In fact without this code from the book I could not possibly do the assignments. On top of that each chapter has homework assignments with code you can get from the author's website. Most of these homeworks do not make you write code, but rather use author's code to step through multi-thread executions and predict their outcomes.

First I'd like to say that the instructors of the course created a very impressive kernel simulation software for the assignments. Super impressive indeed. It's like a miniature copy of a Linux OS. However the code base is 30000+ lines of code and it's INSANE. Impossible to understand. I had to trace files/code that depend on each other so much, I had to BUY A SECOND MONITOR just so I could look at it all and try to understand it. The code has so much required reading it's crazy. 95% of my time was spent reading insanely complicated low level kernel code (sometimes even assembly).

OK I can understand that... this is supposed to be ""real world experience"" because if I get a job I'll have to work with large systems and read others' code. The lecturer said that much. But this was definitely not Core CS level. It's even beyond Advanced CS level I think. It's at least Pro CS level (but even most pros would fail at this, since Linux kernel development is far more difficult than other ""pro"" work). I sincerely do not expect any one of the Advanced Applications or Specializations to be ONE TENTH of this course in difficulty. If I ever entertained any delusions about becoming a kernel developer, they are dead and done.

I would say that the first assignment was.... OK, fair and doable with help from OSTEP/Github (but definitely not with what I got from the lectures). It required not too many lines of code, maybe a bit over 200. I still had to get some hints from other people on Github who wrote their own solutions. Semaphores were already provided, I could use that code as example and just make some changes. The code I had to write was clearly indicated as ""fill in the blanks here"". I implemented other synchronization primitives (locks, condition variables, reader-writer locks), and solved some classic synchronization problems. In fact I had an ""aha!"" moment when I solved the Buffalo Intersection problem, it felt amazing. It just clicked, and I put a semaphore into the code, and, voila! Max concurrency achieved!

Now we get to the second and third assignments. Oh boy this was pure hell.

ASST2 asked us to design our own process/file handle/file descriptor/PID/system call system  FROM SCRATCH. Holy hell. There was far less code provided. We also had to create a very very long design document. It took me 2 months to just write the design document. Just tracing one system call takes you through 10+ different files... I had absolutely no idea whatsoever where to start on designing any of that. I could read the actual, real-life Linux kernel code and base my design on that... but come on. I had to get some idea from others on Github. After a ton of struggle for a total of 3 months my 800+ lines of code could pass most of the tests with the exception of some tests that were reported possibly bugged. The instructors already admit that ""at this point the code is so complicated, it's already becoming impossible to debug anything so don't even bother"". Good luck trying to sort through the horrible text interface of GDB.

ASST3 was straight up INSANE. It asked us to design OUR OWN virtual memory system FROM SCRATCH. This is equivalent to 2200+ lines of code MINIMUM. No skeleton code provided whatsoever.  There were far less instructions/help than ASST2. At least the lecturer is honest and he admitted that ""this is supposed to drive you insane and make you tear out your hair."" At this point I threw in the towel and just cheated. I looked at others' code on Github and tried to make sense of it (also realized a lot of repos stopped after ASST2). I wrote some code in no way I could call my own. Anyways I decided to consider it closed and move on to the next course in OSSU. I could go on for several more paragraphs into detail of this hell but this is already too long.

You may object by saying ""you just suck at C"" but in no way this was due to my lack of C knowledge or shortcomings. After all I finished ASST1 and 2 (admittedly with LOTS of help). No amount of C programming books/courses would help. Yes there was a function with triple pointers at some point, but I understand all that.

DESPITE ALL THAT I think the course might be worthwhile for some people out there, who are very hardcore and want to challenge themselves super hard, and want to go into low level programming. So it makes sense to keep it in Advanced Systems (where it would be an elective). Even in that case though, definitely read OSTEP anyways and check out others' code on Github.",2020-04-25T06:11:34Z,690,,,,[]

Pro CS is arbitrary and not the appropriate tone.

**Duration**:
2020-April-01

**Background**:
Pro CS starts out by stating:
> After completing the requirements of the curriculum above, you will have completed the equivalent of a full bachelor's degree in Computer Science

This should be followed by, CONGRATULATIONS. And some quotes from Oh the Places You'll Go. At the end of the curriculum, hopefully students will know enough about CS and themselves to choose a path going forward. It's not clear that this is the place to include yet more courses.  But that's what Pro CS does.

It's not clear why the particular courses listed in Pro CS were chosen. Some may be graduate level work. But at the very least the Android Developer Nanodegree certainly is not.

The next section, ""Where to go next"" seems much more appropriate for the end of the curriculum. It gives some general advice (like a commencement address would). And is light in tone.

375,2020-03-23T02:34:15Z,https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/679,Request for Comment: Clarify Our Curricular Guidelines,"**Problem**:
OSSU references a wide variety of curricula and guidelines, making course evaluation more difficult.

**Duration**:
2020/04/20

**Background**:
OSSU’s tagline is simple and clear. To provide a `Path to a free self-taught education in Computer Science!` Our summary further clarifies that `It is designed according to the degree requirements of undergraduate computer science majors, minus general education (non-CS) requirement[s]`.

At the same time, OSSU has three different sections that discuss our [academic requirements](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science#references), [references](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science#references) or [curricular guidelines](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/master/extras/curriculum_guidelines.md). Even within these, there are multiple references. Curriculum Guidelines refers to both the ABET program criteria and the ACM/IEEE curriculum guidelines. If these conflict, which should be paramount?

Only one of the resources in all of these sections aligns with OSSU’s mission: CS2013, the Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Programs in Computer Science from ACM/IEEE. The goal of CS2013 is “to establish international curricular guidelines for undergraduate programs in computing.” The document establishes a number of principles to which its advice must adhere. These include:

* The CS2013 guidelines must be relevant to a variety of institutions.
* CS2013 should provide guidance for the expected level of mastery of topics by graduates.
* The size of the essential knowledge must be managed.

All are applicable to OSSU.

CS2013 provides clear expectations for a CS curriculum; which topics must be covered and to what extent. The level of detail provides a rubric that can be used to judge necessary changes to OSSU.

Multiple RFCs have already incorporated CS2013 advice as justification. In Issues it is the most referenced resource from the academic requirements, references and curricular guidelines. Codifying its primacy will make it clearer to new contributors how to evaluate resources for addition to OSSU.

**Proposal**:
* List CS2013 as the solo curricular guideline.
* Create a page for Alternate Curricula. 
    * List other self taught curriculum guides here (e.g. Teach Yourself CS, p1xt)
    * List ABET under a section for alternate curricular guidelines. Guidelines from other accreditation bodies (i.e. other countries) can similarly be included.
    * Make clear that these are high quality resources, but not our guideline documents.

**Alternatives**:
1) Move all resources to curriculum guidelines. This would not clarify our guidelines, but at least consolidates information in the same place.

2) Choose a different curricular guideline, perhaps ABET. There are a few challenges to this. First, ABET is underspecified. [CS2013 allows OSSU to judge whether prolog should be a required or elective course](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/669#issuecomment-599303642). ABET states programs must have, “Substantial coverage of algorithms and complexity, computer science theory, concepts of programming languages, and software development.” but does not go further in detail. Second, ABET focuses primarily on American universities, while CS2013 explicitly international in scope.

OSSU does not teach students to use the tools of computing.

**Duration**:
2020/04/20

**Background**:
OSSU has long discussed the need to teach nuts and bolts tools to students. The wiki proposing a possible v9 includes [a section with a number of different resources](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/wiki/Tools-of-CS-draft-(WIP)) to meet this goal.

Recently a team at MIT have taken an in person class on tooling and made it's materials available online. They call this [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/). The course has recorded lectures. It also includes exercises that students are encouraged to undertake.

These topics, how to use version control, what the terminal shell is, how to use the most ubiquitous command line editor, will help OSSU students across a wide range of courses and projects.

**Proposal**:
Add ""The Missing Semester of Your CS Education"" in Intro to CS, after ""Introduction to Computer Science and Programming using Python.""

**Alternatives**:
1) [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/) is a set of open source lessons along similar lines. As text resources, these look very fleshed out, but there are no recorded lectures. Students can follow along with the instructions on their own machine, but there are no independent exercises.

2) OSSU could recommend a collection of courses that focus on the various topics. Udacity's ""How to Use Git and Github"" was an excellent course, it may be that their current [Version Control with Git](https://www.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123) is similarly good. Similar high quality courses would need to be found for shells, command line editors, etc.

3) CMU offers [Great Practical Ideas in CS](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~07131/f19/) which covers similar material. However, the material is text only and less fully explained than Software Carpentry. While CMU students have access to labs, these are password protected and not available to others.

The changelog is out of date and provides limited value.

**Duration**: 2020, April 15

**Background**:
OSSU historically maintained a changelog. In this log, OSSU stated that ""This project adheres in spirit to Semantic Versioning."" (Semver) Before today, the most recent change in the log was from 2017.

Today, OSSU does not attempt to adhere to Semver. The top commitment is to our mission, a path to a complete CS education using freely available online materials. In order to achieve that mission, OSSU has been evaluating the curriculum against [CS2013](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/education/cs2013_web_final.pdf). This has included proposals to de-emphasize some study and to elevate other topics.

Further, the changelog provides limited value. Individuals who wish to see what the curriculum looked like at any point in the past can simply use the git history. Any commit should have a comment explaining the change. This should include reference to an issue where contributors discussed the proposal. Maintaining the changelog simply creates a new document that must be updated and maintained with information that's already captured elsewhere.

**Proposal**:
Remove the changelog and the commitment to semver.

**Alternatives**:
1) Rededicate ourselves to semver. Require that all commits update the changelog as well. Here is [an article](https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/wordpress/semantic-versioning) that is a proponent of semver. This option would require that OSSU determine what version the curriculum is currently at. The major version would likely change a number of times during the current evaluation of OSSU against the CS2013.

This has the advantage of keeping the excellent HtDP courses, which is definitely at the right difficulty for beginners and starts off by teaching good practice with TDD and Data Driven Development. It keeps introduction to a C-like language (conveniently, it's C) with CS50, too, so we aren't losing out there.",2020-03-17T23:08:10Z,671,,,,[]

But I had to do it differently than how it's introduced here. The 'Learn you a Haskell' is super long, and you have to read a lot of unnecessary content to learn about laziness and monads, and when you do, there's aren't any exercises to practice. This book is a good reference manual, but not a great introduction.

Here are two version of a Haskell class (lecture notes, then homework) that both cover laziness, purity, and monads. I'm learning a lot more from these classes than the book (but maybe that's partially because I've spent time reading the book before taking these classes too). Regardless, I think the class is a beneficial substitution:

Reliable Distributed Systems is an elective level course that is only partially available.

**Duration**:
Feb 29, 2020

**Background**:
OSSU promises the equivalent of an undergraduate degree in Computer Science. In order to evaluate our recommended courses, we use the Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Programs in Computer Science (CS2013). More information can be found [here](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/dev/extras/curriculum_guidelines.md).

CS2013 details Parallel and Distributed Computing as an essential knowledge area. But within this knowledge area, the topic of distributed computing is labeled an elective.

Separately, the current recommendations for distributed systems are Reliable Distributed Algorithms 1 & 2. Unfortunately, the assignments are unavailable. The first course has been offline for 2 years. The second course is still listed, but the virtual machine image used to distribute the programming environment is no longer available. The specification for the assignments in the second course are still available, it is possible that the programming environment could be created from scratch. Fortunately the lectures for both classes are available as a Youtube playlist.

There are two other courses that cover similar material. Both are free to audit (watch lectures) but require payment to view assignments:
_Cloud Computing Concepts, Part 1_ is the first of a 6 course specialization on Cloud Computing.
_Distributed Programming in Java_ is the last of three courses in a specialization. Being the last in the specialization, the class may require students to take the earlier courses to follow the material.

**Proposal**:
1) Remove Reliable Distributed Systems from the main curriculum.
2) Add Cloud Computing to Extras/Courses.

**Alternatives**:
a) Simply move Reliable Distributed Algorithms to Extras/Courses.

b) Place _Distributed Programming in Java_ in Extras/Courses. This choice would require some study to determine if this third course in the specialization can be completed without the previous two courses (Parallel Programming in Java, Concurrent Programming in Java). Students would be welcome to take these two other courses. Note that there is currently a free Udacity course with C++ assignments that covers the same topics as Parallel Programming in Java.",2020-03-04T08:46:48Z,640,,,,[]
400,2020-01-26T19:51:14Z,https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/639,Request for Comment: Add Security Courses,"**Problem**:
OSSU:CS does not give students the proper broad introduction to information security.

**Duration**:
Feb 29, 2020

**Background**:
OSSU promises the equivalent of an undergraduate degree in Computer Science. In order to evaluate our recommended courses, we use the Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Programs in Computer Science (CS2013). More information can be found [here](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/dev/extras/curriculum_guidelines.md).

CS2013 specifies a number of knowledge areas a curriculum must cover, one of which is Information Assurance and Security (IAS). This is described as ""...the set of controls and processes both technical and policy intended to protect and defend information and information systems by ensuring their confidentiality, integrity, and availability, and by providing for authentication and non-repudiation."" There are 6 topics within this knowledge area.
* Foundational Concepts in Security
* Principles of Secure Design
* Defensive Programming
* Threats and Attacks
* Network Security
* Cryptography

It is important to note that the expectation is generally just an introduction of these areas. There need only be 1-2 hours of lecture material on each topic (this time does not count course readings, assignments, etc, which will be extra time). The learning outcomes on most topics expect only that students are familiar with the topics, not necessarily that they have used them. For example, students must be able to ""Explain why input validation and data sanitization is necessary in the face of adversarial control of the input channel."" Asking students to undertake data sanitization goes above and beyond the curricular requirements. (It should be noted that students may certainly choose electives that far exceed the general requirements.)

The four learning outcomes that expect students to demonstrate 'usage' are:
* Analyze the tradeoffs of balancing key security properties (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability).
* Classify common input validation errors, and write correct input validation code.
* Demonstrate using a high-level programming language how to prevent a race condition from occurring and
how to handle an exception.
* Demonstrate the identification and graceful handling of error conditions.
Only 2 of these expect students to write code.

**Proposal**:
Add three courses to the curriculum:
* [Information Security: Context and Introduction](https://www.coursera.org/learn/information-security-data)
* [Principles of Secure Coding](https://www.coursera.org/learn/secure-coding-principles)
* [Identifying Security Vulnerabilities](https://www.coursera.org/learn/identifying-security-vulnerabilities)

And give students the option between one of these two courses:
* [Identifying Security Vulnerabilities in C/C++Programming](https://www.coursera.org/learn/identifying-security-vulnerabilities-c-programming)
* [Exploiting and Securing Vulnerabilities in Java Applications](https://www.coursera.org/learn/exploiting-securing-vulnerabilities-java-applications)

**Alternatives**:
a) Use only one course to cover all of the IAS topics:
* [Introduction to Cyber Security](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/introduction-to-cyber-security)

b) Choose one of the following specializations (which go more in depth).
* [Cybersecurity](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/cyber-security)
* [Fundamentals of Computer Network Security](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/computer-network-security)

OSSU:CS requires far more math than our curricular guidelines suggest.

**Duration**:
Feb 29, 2020

**Proposer**:
Waciuma Wanjohi

**Background**:
OSSU refers to two curricular guidelines. These guidelines are created by professional and non-governmental organizations: ABET, ACM and IEEE. More information about these can be found here: https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/dev/extras/curriculum_guidelines.md

The Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Programs in Computer Science (CS2013) is the more specified of the two guidelines. In it, there is a discussion of the necessary math requirements for an undergraduate CS education. To quote the authors, ""CS2013 only specifies mathematical requirements that we believe are directly relevant for the large majority of all CS undergraduates (for example, elements of set theory, logic, and discrete probability, among others).""

The guide continues, ""CS2013 distinguishes between the foundational mathematics that are likely to impact many parts of computer science—and are included in the CS2013 Body of Knowledge— from those that, while still important, may be most directly relevant to specific areas within computing. For example, an understanding of linear algebra plays a critical role in some areas of computing such as graphics and the analysis of graph algorithms. However, linear algebra would not necessarily be a requirement for all areas of computing"".

Similarly, ABET specifies, ""One year of science and mathematics: Mathematics: At least one half year that must include discrete mathematics.""

Currently, OSSU:CS recommends students take Math for Computer Science, which matches both guidelines' expectations of teaching discrete mathematics. But OSSU:CS also requires the equivalent of 2 additional math courses in Core Math and another 2 courses in Advanced Math. This goes far beyond the recommendations.

There is still a general expectation that CS students demonstrate the ability to handle college level mathematics. CS2013 states ""a CS program must provide students with a level of 'mathematical maturity.' To wit, some programs use calculus requirements not as a means for domain knowledge, but more as a method for helping develop such mathematical maturity and clarity of mathematical thinking early in a college-level education."" The ABET program criteria states, ""The additional mathematics might consist of courses in areas such as calculus, linear algebra, numerical methods, probability, statistics, number theory, geometry, or symbolic logic.""

OSSU:CS must ensure that our prerequisites match this expectation. Students should be encouraged to choose 1 additional math course after discrete mathematics.

**Proposal**:
1) Move Linear Algebra to Advanced Math.
2) Move Calculus 1A, 1B, 1C into Advanced Math.
3) Move Introduction to Logic into Advanced Math.
4) Move Multivariable Calculus into [Extras/Courses](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/dev/extras/courses.md).
5) Add language making clear that students need only take one Advanced Math course.

**Alternative**:
CS2013 states, ""undergraduate CS students need enough mathematical maturity to have the basis on which to then build CS-specific mathematics (for example, as specified in the Discrete Structures Knowledge Area)"". This suggests that students would benefit from taking their elective math course _before_ taking Mathematics for Computer Science. OSSU could move the math elective earlier in the curriculum.

**Future Work**:
When offering math options for CS students, the ABET standards call out a number of disciplines where OSSU does not have a recommendation: numerical methods, statistics, geometry. OSSU should identify the best course(s) for each of these. Students with experience taking MOOCs in these disciplines are encouraged to open an RFC making a particular recommendation (e.g. create an issue with the title ""Request for Content: Add University of Amsterdam's Statistics MOOCs to Advanced Math""). High quality RFCs will reference student reviews, syllabus/assignment comparison between courses, and other evidence of course quality.",2020-03-04T07:49:36Z,637,,,,[]
403,2020-01-23T13:59:12Z,https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/636,Request for Comment: Removing/Replacing Software Construction,"**Problem:**
Both the Software Construction courses are terrible in quality and do not teach much. UBC has also decided to force students to pay to have access to the problem sets.

**Duration:**
Feb 29, 2020

**Current State:**
Awaiting feedback

**Proposer:**
riceeatingmachine

**Details:**
As I myself took the SC course and as many others have pointed out (https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/422#issuecomment-385592611 for one), the quality of the SC is really bad.

The course is a part of the Software development micromasters from EdX, consisting of 6 courses in total.

The first two (How to Code - simple data and complex data) are very good and rigorous, although somewhat monotonous but they teach you very much. This is because the teacher for those courses was teaching these in some MOOC or another for many years before the micromasters was a thing.

It appears that UBC had some commitment to EdX to produce the other 4 courses but did not want to do it, so it produced very quick and superficial courses just to satisfy those commitments.

There are no TAs, the setups are outdated, and the final capstone project is all but abandoned, as you can see in the reviews here or by enrolling and reading the discussion forum:

https://www.classcentral.com/course/edx-software-development-capstone-project-8198

To add insult to injury, UBC forces to to pay to take these terrible and abandoned courses, which itself is against the principles of the OSSU.

**Proposals:**

**Option 1:** Removing the SC courses altogether

As they do not teach much in the courses, I do not think anything is really lost by removing them form the syllabus. In fact, removing them kind of improves the OSSU by making it less bloated and more streamlined.

There is no knowledge lost. The only thing I learnt form SC was that code can be split into various files and imported to the main file for development ease.

Here, we could add a link to the Java tutorials to introduce the student to OOP.

https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial//java/index.html  

**Option 2:** Using the old MIT courses

MIT used to have 6.005 available on EdX (now archived but accessable)

https://www.edx.org/course/software-construction-in-java

OCW version: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-005-software-construction-spring-2016/

@Alaharon123 pointed this course out to me, although I have not taken it yet. The Java Tutor bits are no longer available.

**Option 3:** Using some sort of book to teach this portion

[Suggestions needed]

Other things:

1. The software development capsone project needs to be removed from the course regardless of the outcome of this discussion. This is because that course is completely abandoned and it's impossible to complete the capstone because the grader does not work anymore. Only one person has completed that project in it's history, and it costs $300 to access that broken course. 

2. Perhaps the entire micromasters needs to be removed and we should bring in a different programming series into the OSSU from a more active university.

 `kstrdup(name)`,
 ` HANGMAN_LOCKABLEINIT(&lock->lk_hangman, lock->lk_name);`
 
sometimes I saw a parameter like `void *` in `locktestthread(void *junk, unsigned long num)`

Now, when I'm unable to answer the question, there's no way to get an explanation or even correspondence with an instructor or aid to ask about it.

I'd suggest we create an answer key for this course on OSSU that OSSU students can consult when they find themselves stuck on an exercise. This would help greatly in that you don't have to simply skip these these exercises anymore, but you can figure out the answer, why that's the answer and where and how you've lapsed in your understanding of the subject and fix it.

Of course we can't give an answer key for the midterm and final, this would only apply to the unit exercises. The question remains however, does this violate the honor code? ",2019-12-20T01:00:20Z,628,,,,[]

MIT 6.0001 is followed by How to Code, which is beginner-friendly, but 6.0001 is not so there's a course before 6.0001 to teach you Python so that 6.0001 doesn't feel so overwhelming so fast. So you've got 3 intro courses right there because none of them seem to really do their job properly. There's also the problem of How to Code being on edX and 6.0001 being primarily on edX although that does have an ocw version.

I propose switching all of those out for [Berkeley 61AS](https://berkeley-cs61as.github.io/textbook.html). In the past this hasn't really been considered because it's based off of SICP (pretty much is SICP tbh), however, this self-paced version includes a Unit 0 that starts from the basics to make it suitable as a true intro class and Calculus is a corequisite rather than a prerequisite.

423,2019-10-13T20:17:37Z,https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/616,Thoughts on reorganization of the curriculum,"## Intro

I know you have made an effort in the past to make this project more friendly, interactive and community-driven. That's the reason I created this issue, because I think OSSU is one of the most friendliest and coolest places to learn CS on Earth. It is a wonderful source of knowledge, assembled by the community. (Well, mostly by few people.)

You may heard people say 'universities are dying' and may even felt it yourself. At least, it is like that for me. I believe this is the reason I discovered OSSU in the first place few years ago, searching for hope in the open source community. That's why I think, at least for now, it may be a powerful alternative, which brings students together, effectively motivates them and produces competitive results against a conservative system.


## Problem/Current State

This repo in it's current state, albeit really cool and well-thought, is 50+ courses and few books (not counting extras) with an estimate of 2 years to complete, devoting 3 hours every day. Maybe it's just me, but I find it quite depressing for a beginner, a person looking forward to show the world his/her first website/game/app/script. Only at the very end of this journey OSSU quickly recommends to do a project.

Moreover, cohorts/forum/chat/subreddit seem not to be very popular for a 50k stars page. Meanwhile, some half-baked Udemy course gets hundreds of upvotes and comments on Reddit and it happens every day in many programming subs. Small Discord channels are being created.

The thing is, people like little wins, fun projects. Especially now, in the age of computer games and YouTube. People like usefulness, practicality. Especially now, when you can enhance your life with code and when a nice portfolio can land you a job. Also, people like to create, and to create together.

I believe you better have a goal in mind while learning something, otherwise you'll almost certainly fail. Therefore I think the learning process should focus on projects. Heavily. Currently we have a small page, which was updated 1.5 years ago, which contains something like 3 projects and a link to some list of projects.

We already know the statistics of MOOCs success rate. And we know the cons of a classical university system. 

Naturally, there are not many success stories from OSSU students. Because it almost entirely is just an unguided list of courses, albeit a good one. Also, if you google OSSU online, you'll find people saying it's too big. It really is. They are afraid before even starting.

## Proposal

I admire the work every contributor has done here, and I think we should do more, do something about it. So people could share a link and say: 'this is THE place'. So the chat and subreddit could be active, so projects could be done together. This place can be changed for better, it can be a cutting edge highly motivating interactive guide, ahead of everything else.

Every student is interested in it. So let's start from polling Reddit? We can find out what students need, and we can listen to the people who already have a job in CS. Finally, we certainly need more people, more opinions, so spreading the word will also help with this.

Please, share your thoughts about it. Does it make sense for you?",2019-12-20T02:00:27Z,616,,,,[]

Course | Duration (Platform) |  Effort (Platform) | Duration (Repo) | Effort (Repo)
-------- | :---------------------: | :---------------: | :---------:  | :--------------------:

[Fundamentals of Computing](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/computer-fundamentals) | 8 months | 6 hours/week | 9 weeks | 138 hours

I wonder, where do Duration and Effort numbers for both of Introduction to Programming courses come from?

For example, Coursera suggests 4 months with 12 hours/week effort for [Python for Everyone](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python), while it is 9 weeks with 58 hours total effort<sup>1</sup> in the repository. That's ~6 hours/week.

4 months ≈ 17 weeks times 12 ≈ 200 hours total. Numbers are really really off here, or did I miss something?

Calculations for [Fundamentals of Computing](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/computer-fundamentals): 8 months ≈ 35 weeks times 6 ≈ 210 hours total. In the repo it is 9 weeks and 138 hours, which is ~15 hours/week.

OSSU has no structure for gathering student judgement of courses.

**Duration**:
Nov 15, 2019

**Current State**:
Awaiting feedback

**Proposer**:
Waciuma Wanjohi

**Details**:
Open Source Society should make it possible for all contributors and students to give meaningful feedback on course quality. Several sites exist that gather and display 5 star ratings and reviews. None of these offer comprehensive course evaluations. Gathering such data will allow OSSU to make informed decisions about course recommendations.

**Proposal**:
Employ a two stage strategy for course evaluation.

1) Ask students to use a modified version of [California State University, Chico's _Rubric for Online Instruction_](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ec9nOCCjtey2Shkm92oI4blcr-sC7jjHPoD0E7wAxOY/edit#gid=726083902) to evaluate the quality of teaching in a course.

2) Ask students to identify the [Computer Science Curricula 2013](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/education/cs2013_web_final.pdf)(CSC2013) _Body of Knowledge_ coverage that a course achieves.

On 1:
CSU Chico's rubric was first written in 2003. It is an evaluation tool used by over 100 institutions of higher education [source](https://udl.berkeley.edu/udl-course-changes/quality-learning-teaching). It evaluates a number of important areas of course development including learner support, instructional design, and student assessment. The rubric evaluates how well courses live up to 25 goals.

On 2:
The Computer Science Curricula 2013 is our primary curricular guideline. But OSSU has not carried out a comprehensive evaluation of the recommended courses to determine if the curriculum meets expectations. By asking students to evaluate completed courses, OSSU can generate the data necessary to undertake this important task.

**Alternatives:**
- OSSU could forego student evaluations of courses and instead rely on outside groups. This would likely lead to surface level understanding of course strengths and weaknesses.
- OSSU could use another rubric for instructional quality. There are a number to choose from:
  - California State University uses the [Quality Learning & Teaching instrument](http://courseredesign.csuprojects.org/wp/qualityassurance/qlt-informal-review/). This was developed on top of the CSU Chico rubric. While it is more modern, it is much longer.
  - CSU's Quality Learning & Teaching instrument focusing only on the ""Core 24"".
  - [Quality Matters](https://www.qualitymatters.org/) Higher Ed rubric. Use of the rubric is restricted to institutions that pay a multi-thousand dollar fee. It is conceivable that OSSU could apply for a grant or dispensation from quality matters.
  - [The Online Instructor Evaluation System created at Park University](https://www.westga.edu/~distance/ojdla/fall83/mandernach83.htm).
- I know of no resource that rivals the CSC2013 in terms of detailed guidance for undergraduate CS instruction. While the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology is a body that 'accredits post-secondary education programs in applied and natural science, computing, engineering and engineering technology', it's [program criteria](http://www.abet.org/accreditation/accreditation-criteria/criteria-for-accrediting-computing-programs-2018-2019/#2) is not nearly as detailed, and would not be useful in evaluating individual course coverage of CS topics.

444,2019-08-29T13:33:37Z,https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/595,Provide course-specific advice.,"I propose having a section accompanying each course to provide any good advice that previous takers of the course might have for future takers.

For example, I am currently taking the Computer Networking course and it has multiple issues with the quizzes/exams. E.g. the midterm exam asks a question about a topic covered in a lecture situated AFTER the exam (this out-of-order problem happens multiple times). Also, the provided answers to some questions are incorrect. Some quick advice to flag up the issue for future students to the effect of _""Warning: Known issues with quizzes/exams. If in doubt, search the course forum (""Piazza"") for guidance.""_ would save them time.

As a second example, all courses on the EDx platform could carry a warning regarding the current timeout/access issues. 

If we have a dedicated section for this, current students may be more inclined to add advice. This would save future students from asking the same questions and getting stuck repeatedly on the same issue.

What do you think?

447,2019-08-27T08:45:18Z,https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/592,Machine Learning course: opportunity for improvement,"I recently completed the [Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) and I have a few comments about it:

1. The format is a little dry: many long videos (a few hours) with instructor followed by a quiz and assignment and the end.

2. The quizzes are infrequent and too simple. There is typically one or two quizzes per week, each of five questions. The questions are mostly multiple choice and just direct recall of information from the videos. They rarely require further thinking/extrapolation.

3. The assignments are shallow. They mostly require inserting one or two lines into a few files and then running to watch the helper code do the bulk of the work. The code to be added is just a direct translation from the given formulas to matrix operations, which has already been covered in greater detail in the LAFF course.

4. There is no additional/further reading/textbook/notes. The only extra info written down are the lecture slides, which are hard to interpret outside of the videos. I don't think it's enough to watch some videos. Further reading is essential.

Possible solutions:

- I read some reviews for the course on Coursera and one mentioned ""Geoff Hinton's Neural Networks course"". I couldn't find this course, only [these lecture videos](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/coursera_lectures.html), but they are not much use on their own.

- I notice that there is a [specialisation](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) by the same instructor, Andrew Ng, on Coursera. Do you have experience with this? Maybe we could make students aware of the full set of courses.
 
- Perhaps we could provide further readings ourselves: relevant papers/textbooks etc.


My concern is that if we just have a course called ""Machine Learning"", students may get the impression that this is enough. If we are to compete with traditional university education, we should encourage students to go much deeper, which, at least near the start, requires a bit of a push.",2019-08-30T09:06:01Z,592,,,,[]

Per #405, this is an old issue going back to 2017 and something that wasn't dealt with. Students need meaningful feedback for learning to happen.

My solution doing the course has been to do the following:

[2015 Online Lecture videos](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-spring-2015/proofs/)

[2015 Readings](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-spring-2015/readings/) 

[2010 Recitation Problems with Solutions](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/recitations/)

[2010 Video Lectures](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/video-lectures/)

The problem sets and recitation problems from the older courses have solutions and have mostly followed the same path as the newer course so far with the occasional reference to something unknown (still, this is better than no solutions). Do you have experience with this course and dealing with this issue? What did you do to solve this?

450,2019-08-21T22:18:27Z,https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/589,Request for Comment: Intro to Programming Courses,"**Problem:**
The first courses in the curriculum are not appropriate for students who do not know how to program.

**Duration:**
September 30, 2019

**Current State:**
Awaiting feedback

**Proposer:**
Waciuma Wanjohi

**Details:**
OSSU lists prerequisites for students. These are all high school level math and science concepts. However, the first course of the curriculum demands a strong grasp of programming. As stated by @bradleygrant, ""[The first course's] biggest downside is it assumes that the student knows Python inside and out by Week 2, which is pretty much unattainable for a first-timer -- especially since the class does little to get you there.""

OSSU promises to detail a ""Path to a free self-taught education in Computer Science!"" That path should be clear about what preparation students need to undertake before starting on the path. Either OSSU must put in clear prerequisites for knowing how to program or OSSU must provide a clear path for beginners to learn how to program.

**Proposal:**
Give students a choice between three different courses that focused on teaching programming.
- [Computing in Python I: Fundamentals and Procedural Programming](https://www.edx.org/course/computing-in-python-i-fundamentals-and-procedural-programming-2)
- [An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/interactive-python-1)
- [Programming for Everybody](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python)

Each of these courses is an introductory programming course from a strong University. None assume prior experience coding. Together these courses have received over 10,000 online reviews on an independent platform.  [Each has an average rating above 4.5 stars](https://www.classcentral.com/report/top-moocs-2019-edition/).

Commenters may wonder at the decision to recommend a choice between three courses rather than a single course. The primary reason is that the introductory courses tend to generate the most debate among OSSU students. De-emphasizing any particular choice should make clear that students are welcome to choose whichever course they think will best suit. Ultimately, a student's success will be determined not by which course they chose first, but by their perseverance through the dozens of courses that follow.

After the intro to programming course, there would follow an introduction to computer science course. This would then be followed by core classes.

**Alternatives:**
OSSU can list basic understanding of programming as a prerequisite. This would allow the first course to be an introduction to computer science rather than an introduction to programming.",2019-10-10T03:05:29Z,589,,,,[]
451,2019-08-21T04:13:43Z,https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/588,Request for Comment: Replacing How to Code,"**Problem:**
Free access to the How to Code courses has been limited. Students have been requesting an alternative.

**Duration:**
September 30, 2019

**Current State:**
Awaiting feedback

**Proposer:**
Waciuma Wanjohi

**Details:**
The tagline of OSSU is ""Path to a free self-taught education in Computer Science!"" In pursuit of this goal, OSSU tells students ""All or nearly all course material prior to Pro CS is available for free.""

Two of the earliest courses in the curriculum are How to Code - Simple Data and How to Code - Complex Data. These are well reviewed courses and have been part of the curriculum since 2015. The draft for the next version of the OSSU curriculum intended to include these courses for the purpose of teaching functional programming.

Students are able to audit the How to Code Courses. However, students report that the audit option does not include quizzes or assessments. In addition, auditing the courses now offers a short time period in which the material is available.

Feedback is a critical ingredient to an educational experience. Indeed, the advantages of an online course vs a printed book lie in primarily three aspects:
1. Automatically graded assignments
2. Instruction delivered through video
3. Forums where students can collaborate

OSSU must endeavor to recommend low cost, high quality online courses. With the recent changes to How to Code, it is time to evaluate whether an alternative course will better suit students.

**Proposal:**
Replace with How to Code with [Introduction to Functional Programming](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-functional-programming-delftx-fp101x-0).

This course is a [well reviewed course](https://www.classcentral.com/course/edx-introduction-to-functional-programming-2147) on functional programming. It is often recommended. [[1](https://itnext.io/pros-and-cons-of-functional-programming-32cdf527e1c2)] [[2](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-online-courses-to-learn-functional-programming)] It is based on the similarly [well reviewed](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/912217.Programming_in_Haskell) book *Programming in Haskell*.

Introduction to Functional Programming is archived on edX. All content is available for free. The course contains lectures, prompts for student exploration and quizzes with answers available.

While the lectures use Haskell as an example of a functional language (and indeed, it is the most famous example of a pure functional language) the course labs offer a variety of languages which students can use to explore concepts. This makes the course more approachable for students.

There are drawbacks to this course. While the course teaches the building blocks of functional programming, it does not expect students to put these parts together to write programs of significance. There is little focus on software development practice. For example, How to Code spends significant time teaching Test Driven Development, a valuable practice to learn early.

**Alternatives:**
There are a number of alternatives to replacing How to Code with Introduction to Functional Programming.

*Supplement or replace How to Code with a recommendation to read How to Design Programs.* How to Design Programs is a [well reviewed](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1119079.How_to_Design_Programs?ac=1&from_search=true) textbook. It is the book upon which How to Code was created. The first edition is [freely available from the publisher](https://htdp.org/). The textbook site includes exercises and solutions. These solutions include the functions that students are expected to have written and example tests that students should have created.

Note: Completely replacing How to Code with the HTDP book would mean that early in the curriculum students would be asked to undertake a course with no video instruction. It is desirable to include courses with video content, and the earlier in the curriculum, the more this factor should weigh.

*Replace How to Code with an alternate course.* There are a handful of other courses on functional programming which are well reviewed or recommended:

- [Functional Programming Principles in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1)
- [Introduction to Functional Programming in OCaml](https://www.fun-mooc.fr/courses/course-v1:parisdiderot+56002+session04/about)
- [Programming Languages, Part A](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages)

*Replace How to Code with an alternate book.* There are a few books on functional programming which are already recommended by OSSU:

- [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters)
- [Haskell Programming from First Principles](http://haskellbook.com/)

*Leave the curriculum as is, without replacing How to Code.* The advantages and disadvantages of this approach should be clear from the Details section.",2019-10-22T02:12:37Z,588,,,,[]

I am currently graduated from high school and have a communication device to speak. I would like go on to post-secondary to learn computer science. Unfortunately, I need an aide to help me. Ex: to push me because I am in a wheelchair and my hands do not work. However, universities or colleges do not have aides to help with my needs. The OSSU would help a lot. It is layed out perfectly and I can be independent. As a student, you like to do questions that are graded to know you are the right track. I tried to do the first course ""How to Code - Simple Data"" and the question page after every video said: ""Graded assessments are available to Verified Track learners. Upgrade to unlock ($125)"". Is every course going to be this way from edX? I thought edX was a non-profit organization to help people who can not go on to universities.  Here is a comment from Reddit about this change: https://www.reddit.com/r/edX/comments/a71824/edx_changes_the_audit_courses_policy_what_do_you/ebzscl9/     I am disappointed and shocked because they were trying to get everyone an equal opportunity.

The benefits are three folds: 
1) It serves as a bonus motivation to complete several courses or sections.
2) Get a sense for which jobs that we can apply after having the particular knowledge from finishing the courses. Since we are self-taught programmers, sometimes, one of the biggest problems is that we keep taking more and more courses because we don't know until when we have the skill needed to make projects or finding a job and stop or pause taking MOOC for a while.
 3) If we suddenly wanted to find a job, we can reach that job milestones in OSSU, pause OSSU to learn something more specific (web framework, programming language, etc), and then we can continue OSSU to brush up more advanced CS foundation after getting the jobs or internship.

Examples of what I thought about:

After sections of Core Programming, we can say:
Job Milestones: After completing this section and the Core Software Engineering section, you have the ability to find a job as an entry web developer. If you want to strengthen your skills as a web developer to find a job, we suggest you take the following courses:
1. Example JavaScript courses (and link)
2. Example ReactJS courses (and link)
3. Other courses (and link)

I see two problems with this. Note that this is coming from someone who looked at the structure of both, but the content of neither so I don't know if one is actually of significantly higher quality or whatever.

1. MIT Software Construction in Java is an archived course and all the Java Tutor parts are no longer available. This appears to mean that the course no longer teaches Java and assumes that you already have that knowledge.

2. The obvious solution would be to instead use the ocw version. This is definitely a better idea; after all, it does include 2 pages intended to teach Java. https://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/6/6.005/s16/getting-started/java.html and https://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/6/6.005/s16/classes/02-basic-java/. However, and someone else can say if this is actually enough to learn Java, it seems pretty cursory to me. MIT even offers a class (not on OCW) specifically to prepare students for 6.005 called 6.178 Introduction to Software Engineering in Java plus a prerequisite of 6.01. All of which means to say, it doesn't seem like the best fit for ossu.

On the other hand, UBC Software Construction only assumes that you've done How to Code: Simple and Complex Data, which are already on the OSSU curriculum. On campus as well, the only prerequisite is cpsc 110, their version of How to Code.

491,2018-12-12T16:09:12Z,https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/548,Calling all students: what was your favorite introduction to computer science?,"Hello everyone,

For the next version of the curriculum, I am currently planning for the ""Intro CS"" section to consist of a small number of community-generated recommendations. Since experience has shown that it is impossible to arrive at a consensus for ""one intro to rule them all"", I'm looking for a handful of resources that cover a wide spectrum of student backgrounds. New students should be able to choose *one* resource out of these recommendations, probably by matching their own personal backgrounds to the backgrounds of the people who recommended a certain resource.

The purpose of Intro CS is to get students' feet wet and inspire them to continue with the rest of the curriculum. Besides the fact that it does need to be some sort of introductory resource, I don't have specific requirements for what content is taught or the manner/format of teaching, as long as it's not irrelevant. The rest of the curriculum starting with Core CS won't make any assumptions about what content students did or did not learn in Intro CS.

My requirement is instead that the Intro CS material be of high overall quality, unlikely to disappear from the Internet, and emotionally engaging/inspiring for *you*, given your background, interests, and tastes. So **I'm asking that you share your story, including what background you had in CS and/or programming before starting the material, and what it was about the resource that inspired you to pursue studies in CS**. We might directly share some student testimonials whose purpose would be to indicate to a new student whether this is the right resource for them to choose.

In the last week of December we'll select 3-5 to put into Intro CS, with the criteria for selection based on variety. Specifically:
- Each video-based course we select should be very different
- Each text-based resource (which could be a book or a tutorial) should be very different
- However, we can group text-based resources together with video-based, i.e. same content for the same backgrounds, but different formats for different learning styles (or bandwidth limitations)",2019-08-21T22:34:53Z,548,,,,[]

493,2018-12-09T11:42:18Z,https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/546,Web site for the OSSU CS Curriculum,"I wounder if anyone else in the **OSSU Community** thinks that a **web site** for the curriculum would have any value for the community members? I mean a simple static site for reference purposes. The old firebaseapp site is out of date and requires time and commitment to maintain. But a simple GitHub Pages site could do the job as well. 

Let me illustrate the idea on my own example. I personally prefer keeping track of my CS progress and a complete log of the related activities in a GitHub repository ([see here](https://github.com/szaitseff/szaitseff.github.io)). But in social networks and for sharing to a wider public (e.g. on CV), I prefer sharing a link to a personal [web site](http://szaitseff.github.io) rather than to the GitHub repository, which may seem a bit confusing for a non-tech public. My web site/page is based on the README.md file in the repository. It was easy to build using the GitHub Pages tool and one of the supported themes. It does not require any maintenance and updates as soon as I update the README.md file.

The OSSU CS Curriculum is currently mostly maintained in one README.md file and could similarly be mirrored to a GitHub Pages site for reference purposes. It would be automatically updated with each update of the README.md file with no maintenance efforts required! The GitHub Pages tool also allows a multi-page site linked to different files in the same project repository if needed. 

Therefore, I call for an **exchange of opinions** from the OSSU community whether a simple web site for the CS Curriculum would be of **any value for members**? I personally find it a bit confusing that, when searching for ""OSSU"" in browser or when giving a reference to the OSSU Curriculum to a general public, the only option available is a GitHub repository. I also think that a mirror of the repository is enough, and no ""login"" or functionality of the firebase site is required, as students can easily track their progress in a public GitHub repository or in a public Trello board.

495,2018-12-08T16:34:43Z,https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/544,How To Code: Simple Data thoughts and observations,"I'll start with the pros, because there are some!  It's clear the tutors worked very hard on the course and making it accessible.

**Pros**

- Ability to use images directly in code, and in general untyped data
- Focus on visual programs that **show** students what their code is producing and how it is doing it.
- TDD (ish).  The introduction of writing tests before coding, even though the implementation is very different to TDD, is a good introduction to how vital tests are and is an important lesson for students to always write thorough tests before delivering a feature
- Every concept is clearly explained as it is introduced, and the teacher then reinforces past knowledge in a similar manner.
- check-random.  Although this hasn't yet been introduced to the user.

**Cons**
[NB some of this is very subjective, and I haven't yet finished the course.  I had intended to so before I wrote this ticket, but after discussion with @hanjiexi I figured I may as well share now]

- The code is ugly and hard to read.  There are parentheses everywhere, both ) and ] but, surprisingly, no }  (yet)
- The instructors insist on using naming conventions that, should they pass through my pull requests, I would reject outright.  In few worlds outside of embedded are variables in functions now just one letter, so why can't we have (define (name-cat name) ...) instead of (define (name-cat n) ...)?  Why name a constant (define P1 0) when you could name it (define START 0).
- There is an overreliance on course design schemas that can only be found in the course, that are overly complicated, and that would be difficult for a beginner to learn.  I shouldn't have to return to a design pattern five times when designing a ""world"" - once for the world, three more times for templates... it's just repetitive and lacks value
- Over-reliance on copy-pasting.  In an almost flagrant disregard of DRY (do not repeat yourself) principles, the instructors have us copy-pasting templates all over the place, even when they add little to no value and make the solution more complex.
- No variables, only constants.  This makes programs far more bracket-heavy than they need to be, and mean that simple tests and function definitions are dragged out over multiple lines
- No objects.  You define structs, but these are essentially read-only collections of data.  They are completely immutable.  A function that needs to take a Cat and return a Cat must make an entirely new Cat.  In object-orientated languages, however, the student would be able to simply call cat.setXPosition(cat.x + SPEED) and have done, compare with (make-cat (+ (cat-x cat) speed) (cat-y cat) (cat-age cat))
- Over-reliance on function calls.  Why, to make a list, must I call (cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 3 (cons 4 empty)))) instead of just (make-list 1 2 3 4) or similar?
- Boundaries on student-defined data structures.  We are essentially writing in a contract and then assuming that whoever calls it will obey this contract, but there is no code enforcing this behaviour.  There is therefore nothing to stop the student from missing a case where they accidentally provide or return the wrong data type.  (NB this is a problem with teaching untyped languages to beginners in general, and is not unique to student language))
- If there is a way to make a zero-argument function I couldn't find it by trial and error (now that I've written this, someone is going to point out it's super easy), and the case isn't covered by the instructors.  Therefore you simply can't implement generators without having them take arbitrary data that they then ignore - something else that would get a stern look in any code review.
- BSL - the language, despite being ugly and full of parentheses) is definitely not equipping the student to find gainful employment, nor the tools to move to e.g. javascript, java, python.

496,2018-12-05T21:37:28Z,https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/543,Opening Gitter rooms for OSSU-CS cohorts,"I am opening this issue on behalf of the members of [OSSU-CS Cohort #23](https://github.com/ossu/cohorts/issues/23).

There has been discussion on the [OSSU Computer Science Gitter room](https://gitter.im/open-source-society/computer-science) about providing an OSSU-sanctioned Gitter room for each of several individual cohorts. The purpose is for cohort members to discuss and share information about the classes they're currently taking, ask questions specific to those courses, check in with their coordinators, and share wins and challenges with their cohort members.

It was suggested that these cohort meeting rooms operate on the main OSSU Gitter page, for several reasons, including but not limited to:

- To provide a central meeting place for all cohorts and all participants within a cohort;
- To bring more visibility to the OSSU cohort system, and encourage other OSSU participants to ""go and do likewise"" and form their own cohorts;
- For OSSU internal tracking of candidate engagement and retention;
- As a form of social proof that the OSSU curriculum is being used successfully;
- In attempt to achieve a critical mass on the Gitter platform rather than splintering OSSU-related services to Yet Another Platform;
- and other reasons as yet unnamed or unidentified.

This issue is twofold:

1. The community is requesting guidance from OSSU as to whether the goals and reasoning listed herein are worthy and representative of the OSSU mission, and whether OSSU desires and intends to support them. **Key Deliverable:** A decision from OSSU as to whether or not they would like to host cohort rooms on the OSSU Gitter page.
2. If affirmative, we would like to implement cohort rooms on the OSSU Gitter page. **Key Deliverable:** We ask the OSSU Gitter moderator(s) to create a cohort room for Cohort #23.
2. (2a) If negative, we request an opinion from OSSU as to what other OSSU-sanctioned space we may use, or where to share a link to our independently-operated meeting space.

499,2018-11-26T21:56:10Z,https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/540,Choosing the introductory course(s) and language,"Much has been left undecided with regard to what Intro CS is going to look like in v9 of the curriculum.

Not wanting to start from scratch (i.e. from my own intuition) in answering this question, I went looking for what experts had to say. I was lucky enough to encounter a dialogue between Yaron Minsky (an experienced industrial developer) and Matthias Felleisen (one of the top academics in computer science pedagogy, and author of *How to Design Programs*), underneath a [blog post](https://blog.janestreet.com/how-to-choose-a-teaching-language/) on this very subject.

Yaron Minsky:
> The first formal programming class I took was COS 217 at Princeton, taught by the excellent (and at the time, I thought, terrifying) Anne Rogers. The course was (and is) taught in C, and the intellectual approach of the class was to start from the machine. Instead of just learning to program in C, we learned about how the machines we were programming to worked. That was where I first encountered instruction counters, stack frames, registers and the memory hierarchy. It was exhilarating.
>
> Where C encourages you to start with the machine, Scheme wants you to start at the mathematical foundations of computation. You don’t need to know what the lambda calculus is to appreciate Scheme’s slim core, and the way in which you can build a rich and vibrant computational world on top of it. That core is expressive enough that it makes it natural to introduce ideas that come up in multiple different languages, including functional and imperative techniques, object orientation, and logic programming.
>
> The classic course in this vein is MIT’s 6.001, also known as SICP, The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programming. Sadly, 6.001 has been retired at MIT, but the book lives on, and is a worthwhile read even if you took your last CS course years ago.
>
> MIT replaced SICP with a course based on Python, and this reflects a broader trend. As was highlighted by an informal study by Philip Guo, lots of schools now teach Python, particularly for early introductory courses. I have mixed feelings about this choice. Python is a wonderfully friendly language, but that friendliness is bundled together with some problems.
>
> This was made apparent to me in part by my experience with students who chose to code in their interviews in Python. In many ways, Python is the ideal interview language, since its concise and readable syntax makes the constraints of coding on the whiteboard more bearable. But what I saw was that students who learn Python often walk away with a rather rough model of the semantics of the language. You might be surprised at what fraction of students who have programmed extensively in Python can’t guess how Python lists might be implemented, to say nothing of their ability to explain the semantics of language features like generators or decorators.
>
> This isn’t really a knock on Python. After all, there’s something great about a tool that lets you get things done without fully understanding how it works. But in different ways, both Scheme and C encourage you to understand what’s going on from the ground up, and there’s a certain pedagogical power in that. All in, I think Python is a great choice for an early introductory course, particularly one meant for those who aren’t going to end up as computer scientists or full-time programmers. But I’d be leery of using it outside of those circumstances.

Matthias Felleisen:
> Yaron, your question -- as stated -- doesn't denote. It needs context. And Bob Muller's ""failure"" is indicative of this problem.
>
> Let's assume you really mean ""teaching programming to young students in high school or in college at the freeman level"" and let's accept that we should not send out kids with one programming course into industry because we also don't send out first-semester pharmacists into pharmacies.
>
> Here is what you will want. First, it needs to be a bit of fun. If your first program is print ""hello world"", these kids can't relate. They haven't seen consoles. They have seen graphical user interfaces, they have seen interactive games (and may have played them) and they have seen animations. A lecturer should show a rocket taking off or a horse bugging going across the screen as the hello-world program, the very first program you ever show.
>
> Second, you are confronting novices. When they get to touch the keyboard, they are guaranteed to do one and only one thing: make mistakes. ALL (note all caps) off-the-shelf languages are geared to give error feedback assuming ""adult"" programmers (people who know most of the language) are the actual users. Invariably this feedback is weird and incomprehensible to novices. ERRORS MATTER.
>
> Third, the language should frame the problem-solving method. Ergo, you first pick a method that gradually takes students from an empty screen and a problem statement to a program that solves the problem (probably). Based on that choice, you create the language that frames this design story. I fully agree that (rich) types (as found in ML or Haskell) are the fundamental guiding system for design. (I have taught with types since 1992.) That does NOT mean that you need to check those types from the beginning. Why? See the second point. A type system is likely to give horrible feedback when novices do what they do best: make mistakes.
>
> Fourth, the second and third point suggest that you use more than one language. And the third point means that the languages ""grow"" on the students with the expansion of the design methodology. Naturally this should end in a typed setting like the ones that you propose. Does it have to be OCaml or SML or Haskell? Bob Muller's experience shows that this is not so. You need to create a language that fits.
>
> Fifth, there is no contradiction between choosing ""Scheme"" and still teaching about ""instruction counters, stack frames, registers and the memory hierarchy."" When I taught at Rice, my course started with a Scheme-like language and always ended with us writing a complete simulator of a cpu, an instruction interpreter, a memory. Then students would write a loader, a linker, and hand-translate Fortran (yes, oh well) into the asm of the simulated machine -- all while observing the functional design recipes that they picked up in the first 12 weeks of the course.

With that in mind, below I'm listing some ideals I want to strive towards.
- **Conceptual simplicity**: prefer elegant but robust mathematical models upon which complexity can be built later, rather than ""easy"" (cf. Python) or ""natural"" (cf. Ruby) models that are fuzzy or confusing when analyzed deeply
- **Practical simplicity**: prefer tools with beginner-friendly syntax (for heaven's sake, NOT JAVA! NOT SCALA!), usability (avoiding both complex IDEs and complicated interaction models like that of Vim), and error messages
- **Level-appropriateness**: valuable features, like type systems, should only be made explicit once the student is ready for them; yet, the student's prior learning should set up the scaffolding for introducing these features later; ideally, the language/tooling scales with the student's progress
- **Resource richness**: there are freely available textbooks, video lectures, and assignments covering the same material, all available in a self-paced manner year-round

My goal now is to evaluate each of the following resources on a spectrum (🙁, 😐, and 😀) based on the above four criteria. I may need help for this since I haven't done all of these course myself.

- **[Harvard CS50](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x)**

You've previously raised an issue (#433) about placement of the ""Hack the Kernel"" class due to ABET's published standard. Here are the latest requirements from v2 of their [CAC criteria](http://www.abet.org/accreditation/accreditation-criteria/cac-criteria/):

> 1. Substantial coverage of algorithms and complexity, computer science theory, concepts of programming languages, and software development.
> 2. Substantial coverage of at least one general-purpose programming language.
> 3. Exposure to computer architecture and organization, information management, networking and communication, operating systems, and parallel and distributed computing.
> 4. The study of computing-based systems at varying levels of abstraction.
> 5. A major project that requires integration and application of knowledge and skills acquired in earlier course work.

We have plenty of 1, 2, and 4. A better projects infrastructure is needed for 5, but I think we should improve the curriculum content first before tackling such a major challenge.

**We currently don't require any major coursework on parallel and distributed computing in Core CS.** The subjects are probably mentioned here and there throughout the existing Core CS curriculum, but it's probably not enough to qualify as ""exposure"".

On the other hand, you recently mentioned to me on Gitter that CS undergrads at Georgia Tech only have *four* courses required of all of them. I think it's pretty common to require a very small number of core courses, and impose taking a minimum number of credit hours among a wide variety of elective courses.

But I wonder, how exactly are schools fulfilling these ABET requirements? Or is ""exposure"" truly much softer than it sounds? Like if distributed computing is an elective that not everyone takes, does that count as ""exposure"" for purposes of fulfilling ABET's requirement?",2020-01-26T21:30:02Z,532,,,,[]

Thus, it doesn't really start ""from zero"". This excludes anyone from the curriculum who is truly starting from nothing, and I don't want our curriculum to be exclusionary.

Therefore, I think we should add [Stanford CS101](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/Engineering/CS101/Summer2014/about) before MIT's intro. It takes a step back and answers much more fundamental questions.

It's probably the closest thing I've found to a MOOC for teaching what you learn in the great book *[Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software](https://www.amazon.com/Code-Language-Computer-Hardware-Software/dp/0735611319)*. It also has a very rudimentary introduction to programming (using a subset of JavaScript), which should help make students more comfortable going into MIT Intro to CS.

Structures would be used for material covering concrete data structures (e.g. arrays), abstract data structures (e.g. stacks), purely abstract structures like categories and abstract machines, and theory-focused applications of those structures to the real world, e.g. (theory of) databases, (theory of) networks.

Additions:
- I want to add category theory material to ""Advanced Structures"".
- I want to add material on persistent data structures to ""Advanced Structures"".",2020-01-26T22:21:53Z,525,,,,[]

The easiest way to solve this problem for right now would be to use Coursera's [Parallel, Concurrent, and Distributed Programming in Java Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/pcdp). It costs money to access assignments, but video lectures can be audited for free, which is (in effect) the same as posting some other kind of non-interactive content, like a random course website, YouTube series, or a book. But unlike many such other resources, this would be more consistent (all in one language) and it wouldn't require any additional prerequisites on top of needing to know Java.

Georgia Tech's CS1301x course is an adaptation of a 16-week on-campus course which first became available on EdX in July 2018, and is offered as a four-part sequence leading to an optional Professional Certificate. Completing this course provides an equivalent background to MIT's 6.00.1x course, but provides more instruction and extensive practice in Python coding, with over 300 short coding problems to help build confidence and muscle memory in a short period of time.

This course also provides access to a free ""adaptive textbook"" which tests one's understanding of the material. A non-adaptive PDF copy is made available for offline reading.

Having taken both courses, in my opinion MITx 6.00.1x provides an excellent introduction to computer science concepts but expects the user to pick up Python more or less on his own. GTx CS1301 serves as a gentler introduction, teaching the same concepts but also taking time to teach Python along the way.

There are zero assignments or practical exercises and the only feedback is via in-video questions, which are pretty basic. I ended up writing notes, so the stuff sticks a bit better, but this course essentially became my chore of the day, where I had to force myself to do at least one video a day. I stopped at the end of week 2.

I don't want to skip this topic however so I was looking for alternatives and only found the following two:

- Georgia Tech's Computer Networking on Udacity: https://eu.udacity.com/course/computer-networking--ud436. This is already listed under Extra's and it doesn't seem to be a direct replacement, because the Stanford course is a lot more basic/low level (please CMIIW). Therefore I don't think it is a valid alternative.
- Computer Networks and the Internet by a small German University on edx: https://www.edx.org/course/computer-networks-internet-kironx-fhlcnx. This seems to cover the same content on the same level as the Stanford course.

This is no longer the case (I just enrolled in Princeton's Algorithm's Part II to test it out: https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2).

Given that both are available again, are there any reasons to chose one over the other purely from a content and didactical point of view?

* [UofHelsinki](http://moocfi.github.io/courses/2016/aalto-c/en/)

I took this course before hearing of CS50. I found it comprehensive and all that I needed to succeed. The multiple programming assignments were graded locally (on my machine) and remotely. The remote option is no longer available, but i believe the local option still works. (If this is not the case, the course does not belong in this list)

* [Duke](https://www.coursera.org/learn/interacting-system-managing-memory)

This course on Managing Memory is part of a [4 course series](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/c-programming) introducing programming with C.

* [Dartmouth](https://www.edx.org/course/c-programming-pointers-and-memory-management)

Similarly, this is the 4th course in a 7 course certificate in [C Programming with Linux](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/dartmouth-imtx-c-programming-with-linux).

* [Text Resource](http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/102/PointersAndMemory.pdf)

This primer on manual memory in C may be appropriate for the Readings page in extras.

I'm currently at week 2 of this course and find it not challenging at all. Looking at the syllabus, the course is very slow paced. I've recently completed [Mathematics for Machine Learning: Linear Algebra](https://www.coursera.org/learn/linear-algebra-machine-learning/), without 'paid' parts, and it seems like the curriculum mostly overlaps. Only that I was able to be done with the Coursera course in less than a month, without much difficulties. 

Matlab part in LAFF seems to be not too useful (at least for our purposes) - based on the comments from the instructors, they're using it because it's easy to set up, and they got free support from Matlab consultants (it's true, I've already got answers to a couple of questions from the consultants). But the way they write Matlab code, it trying to resemble C, and Fortran. Here's a comment from the instructor (emphasis mine):

> (...) A purpose of the course is to code in Matlab, **but to mimic how one would instead code if one were to use C (or, heavens forbid, Fortran)**. In the enrichments, you will learn about the Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms, a standard interface to operations on matrices and vectors. That interface was designed for Fortran code (since scientific code used to be primarily coded in Fortran). Our laff_xxxx functions kind of sort of mimic that. In addition, it will allow you to visualize how the code acts on matrices and vectors later in the course using the PictureFLAME tool.

and:

> You really shouldn't get too caught up in the Matlab vs Python issues. Starting in 1.6 **we layer our own ""Domain Specific Language"" on top of Matlab and Python**, which means which language you use is completely irrelevant to the learning you will enjoy in this course.

We already have a few courses in the curriculum with DSL (How To Code, and Nand2Tetries are ones I'm 100% sure about). At some point computer science students should start programing in languages used in the industry, not learning one DSL afer anothter. 

A huge upside of this course is that both instructors are extremely active on the discussion groups - I've never seen anything like that in any MOOC. Most of the time they seem to be answering the questions on the same day you ask them.

I know it's a bit early to judge course after 1.5 weeks, but I am not really sure if I should invest 12 weeks into this course, if the material can be covered in 3-4 weeks. Can anyone who actually completed the course give their thoughts on whether it is worth keeping it in the curriculum? Should we replace it with something shorter, more fast-paced, and using a language like Python, or R (or even Matlab, but written in a Matlab way, without mimicking C or Fortran)? Or maybe suggest LAFF as an optional course for students who need more time for math (e.g. someone that is coming to Computer Science from Humanities, and not, Finance, Economics or Engineering)?

543,2018-08-21T04:16:32Z,https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/496,Just to be safe,"I think it would be a good idea to recommend books that can substitute and/or complement an entire curriculum subsection (Core CS, Core Math, etc.) by it's sets of courses (for example, Core programming has 3 sets of courses: How To Code, Software Construction and Programming Languages, so the curriculum would recommend 3 or more books for each set).

Many good books are available for free by the author such as How To Design Programs that, if I'm not mistaken, is what the set of courses ""How to code"" is based on. Taking in account that ""How To code - Complex Data"" has been locked behind a paywall, recommending the base book for this set of courses (or some better alternative) would greatly benefit students.

I suggest the community to not hold back on recommending paid books as well, even when no free option is available, since the book plan is also a fail-safe if the free course it substitutes get behind a paywall, and let's be honest, you can download many books online for free if you really don't have any money (not that I'm encouraging it, I think it's better to look for good prices on what you want or buy used books, for example, I got the elements of computing systems for 8 dollars, but that's because I prefer paperback books, some people prefer the Kindle version, that can be even cheaper, and public libraries can have quality books if you have one near you).

I understand the idea behind OSSU, but I think suggesting free and paid books at all sections (whenever possible) of the curriculum can greatly improve it.",2018-08-23T03:52:12Z,496,,,,[]

My personal opinion is that Github + Gitter is not really a good way to organize discussions. Github is for issues - have a problem/bug, post it, get a solution, close. We can't even (self) organize issues by topic (I'm referring to labels).

I have a suggestion 
In Core systems ,
Content provided by the two-course series ""From NAND to tetris"" of Coursera
is repeated in the Edx's three-course series of MIT ""Computation Structure""

the two series teach the same content though MIT's is more comprehensive 
(i.e teaches how to build a computer from transistors bottom up and then introduce advanced topics in parallelism , intercommunication and Operating Systems 

I think this course should be listed in Core Systems instead of Advanced Systems 

it has no prerequisites other than ability to write a for-loop and if condition in C  no wonder it's one of beginner's courses at MIT or ""Survey level courses "" that provide an introduction to a wide range of topics related to systems and programming .",2018-09-27T23:09:58Z,494,,,,[]

- How to Code: Complex Data
- Software Construction: Object-Oriented Design
- Software Development Capstone Project

Paywalling How to Code: Complex Data hurts. It's one of the best courses we have and now we have to remove it. I understand that edX had to make [a business decision](https://blog.edx.org/furthering-the-edx-mission) to support themselves, but it really messes up our curriculum as is and creates uncertainty about whether we can rely on any edX courses to stay free-to-access.

This underscores the need to replace all proprietary content in our curriculum with open-source content and ultimately to self-host our content as much as possible. How to Code: Complex Data is actually under a [semi-open license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/), so hypothetically we could host parts of it ourselves. (I am less concerned about the other two courses, in fact I don't care at all about losing Software Construction.)

Self-hosting open-source content is a big deal and a ton of work, and we would face some funding questions ourselves. Discussion about that should go in #422. For right now, in order to maintain as much stability in our curriculum as we can, I'm thinking to:
- temporarily replace ""How to Code"" with the book upon which it's based ([*How to Design Programs*](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/))
- completely remove Software Construction; I'm not finding any good alternatives and we do have some coverage of object-orientation elsewhere in the curriculum
- replace the Software Development Capstone Project course with our own required capstone project

On basis of my research and experince i have noticed some significant difference between being a CS guy and being a IT guy. 
but i strongly belive that a combination of CS and a IT will be awesome.
the fundaments difference between a CS and a IT guy is that CS guys knows the skeleten part of the computer's very well like physics and maths behind computers and a IT guy knows to use the Computer tools really well. 
as said in nand2tetris most of the IT guys just deal with the API level of Computers. 

Sites like Udemy , cbt-nuggets are for the IT guys and sites like edx.org and MITOCW and MOOCS are for CS guys. 
but development in both the fileds is actually required to be a successfull computer engineer. 

I have some alternatives to udemy like spoken-tutorial.org which provides tutorials on tools of computers. I think some of these kinds of sites which provides free skill set's on increasing yours typing speed , using tools , and other IT stuffs can be added in next level.

While they do address ""theory and practice of distributed algorithms for designing scalable, reliable services"" they seem to be the most practical and applied of all the courses in the theory track. It's not clear that any theory learned in these courses could apply outside of their topic area (as opposed to a theory course like Logic, which has broad connections to a variety of disciplines within and without computer science).

This course seems more appropriate for Advanced Systems.

1. It's unquestionably a systems course
2. A student who completes OSS in Advanced Systems today would never move beyond studying systems on a single computer, a serious problem in an era of distributed computing and server farms.

We should also note that Reliable Distributed Systems I is currently not available (not even as an archived course). Reliable Distributed Systems II is still available, so perhaps another run of the course is coming.

I propose that Reliable Distributed Systems I and II be moved to Advanced Systems and that we revisit them in the summer. If no new session is planned, a replacement course should be determined.",2020-01-27T05:16:29Z,459,,,,[]

I've been researching online CS curriculums and came across this one (which is awesome).

I've seen consistently that CS curriculums usually have the first few courses in the program as:
* Intro to programming (often multiple courses)
* Discrete structures/math
* Data structures 
* Algorithms

I noticed that there is no explicit Data Structures course in this program. I see that the suggested Algorithms course briefly touches on data structures, but doesn't seem like an entire course worth of material. 

I also see that the Core Programming stuff has some content on data abstraction but I'm not sure if thats the same idea as data structures (I'm actually not really sure what the Core Programming content maps to in a University curriculum?). 

I'm sure you all have considered the content for this program a lot so apologies if I'm being critical! Is there something I'm missing or is this just a design decision? (I program but don't have a CS background). Thanks!",2018-02-15T16:36:53Z,458,,,,[]

Possible candidates:
- [Parallel programming](https://www.coursera.org/learn/parprog1)
- [Parallel Programming in Java](https://www.coursera.org/learn/parallel-programming-in-java)
- [Parallel Programming Concepts](https://open.hpi.de/courses/parprog2014)

I couldn't find anything on edX. From the above three, the first two are on Coursera and, though I haven't tried them out yet, they look like those annoying courses that lock you out of some assignments if you don't pay. The third one is on a platform I've never heard of and I have no idea if it's any good.

In the future I want parallelism to be much more strongly emphasized in the curriculum. Back in 2011, Carnegie Mellon (basically the top CS school in the US, particularly for undergraduate education) initiated a comprehensive reform of their curriculum, the reasons for which can be read in [this report](http://link.cs.cmu.edu/files/ugrad-report.pdf).

They moved to emphasizing parallelism (and functional programming) almost from the very beginning in freshman CS courses. They basically did this to ""future-proof"" their students against the deterioration of Moore's law. In other words, CPUs aren't getting much faster, so instead manufacturers are just adding more CPU cores. To take advantage of all those cores you need to think differently about how you program. Their belief is that highly imperative, sequential code is brittle and will be a thing of the past some day.

All of which makes sense to me and I want to future-proof our curriculum as well, but unfortunately free resources on the topic are still sparse. There is [a free textbook](http://www.parallel-algorithms-book.com/) that looks interesting. So this kind of reform to our curriculum is still very much a work in progress and I don't know how long it will be before we get there.",2020-01-27T04:33:05Z,449,,,,[]

I was able to make my own game but as I had performance problems, I decided to get a computer science foundation before I move to game development. Here I am.

I have taken CS50. The teacher is great. Course is a good starting point. But in my opinion, it is a good start if you are at Harvard campus where you have office hours, sections, labs etc. Each lecture touchs a very big topics superficially. And those who are at campus can digest the content with the help of CS50 staff. We don't have that. 

First few lectures were not that hard for me and I was able to solve problem sets. But as it started to get more advanced with topics like memory and data structures, I was just watching the lecture and practicing what I saw at lecture. I had a hard time with problem sets. This is not because problem sets are supposed to be hard. The content that I have to learn to understand the problem sets and answer them was not fully digested as the lecture was broad and not every concept fully explained in detail.
Also keep in mind that I had some exposure to programming before.

Here is what I suggest and this is the path I am following now. There needs to be some beginner friendly course that helps you understand the basics before you move on with CS50.

The concern that I expressed, and will again here, is that we don't want to go overboard in the prerequisites section by listing every possible thing a student needs to know. But there is clearly still some demand for some recommended prerequisites courses, so maybe we can draw the line at (1) subjects that aren't universally taught to all English-speaking high school students, as well as including (2) any subjects that are likely to need a serious refresher by those who have been out of high school for a while.

For example, I assume all high schoolers everywhere have to learn algebra, but it seems not all of them take pre-calculus. Or perhaps they do, but at the very least, pre-calculus is complex enough that those who graduated high school a long time ago might benefit from refreshing their memory of the subject. So I would consider pre-calculus valid for inclusion, but not algebra or geometry.

So if we are agreed on adding precalculus to the Prerequisites section, I want to clarify something: is ASU Precalculus largely sufficient on its own?

The textbook teaches operating systems.

- From OSS: ""...Nand2Tetris does not go deep enough into operating systems...""
- From Three Easy Pieces: ""The book is centered around three conceptual pieces that are fundamental to operating systems: virtualization, concurrency, and persistence. In understanding the conceptual, you will also learn the practical, including how an operating system does things like schedule the CPU, manage memory, and store files persistently.""

The final course of Advanced Systems is ops-class.org. This class (Hack the Kernel) ""includes everything you need to learn about operating systems online."" The course introduction lists the conceptual progression as:

- Introduction to operating system abstractions and structure.

- Abstracting and multiplexing:

    - the CPU—​interrupts, context, threads, processes, processor scheduling, thread synchronization.

    - memory—​memory layout, address translation, paging and segmentation, address spaces, translation caching, page fault handling, page eviction,

    - swapping.

    - storage—​spinning disks and Flash, spinning disk scheduling, on-disk layout, files, buffer cache, crash and recovery.

- Virtualization.

- Networking (time permitting)

The course textbook is Modern Operating Systems by Andrew Tanenbaum. This is an introductory operating system textbook. It is often compared to Three Easy Pieces.

One of these should be moved to Extras. Previous discussions have affirmed OSS's commitment to resources which provide feedback. By this criteria, **_Hack the Kernel_ should stay in the required curriculum and _Three Easy Pieces_ should be made optional.**

The next question becomes, should Hack the Kernel stay in Advanced Systems or move to Core Systems? The new [ABET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABET) program [criteria for computing programs](http://www.abet.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/CAC-Criteria-Version-2.0-2018-193221.pdf) specifies:

- Exposure to computer architecture and organization, information management, networking and communication, operating systems, and parallel and distributed computing

As all students must be exposed to operating systems, **Hack the Kernel should be moved to Core Systems.**

I will note that I like Three Easy Pieces (you can actually find me in one of the textbook's endnotes). I think **a note should be added to Core Systems that we recommend reading Three Easy Pieces as a textbook for Hack the Kernel rather than Modern Operating Systems**. Reasoning: Three Easy Pieces has higher ratings on Goodreads and on Amazon than Modern Operating Systems. It is available free online.

Of course, these are evident once students dig into each course, but why not show it in the repo as well?

A simple example would be courses through edX that offers a certificate for $50 upon completion or a more complex one is the Software Development MicroMasters program when people are doing the ""Core programming"" section. You're already doing all 6 courses from that MicroMasters program, why not earn that ""credential"" while doing them?

616,2017-09-09T18:32:22Z,https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/423,Linear algebra resources,"In issue #418, a number of students raised issues about the course we're currently recommending for linear algebra ([LAFF](https://www.edx.org/course/linear-algebra-foundations-frontiers-utaustinx-ut-5-05x-0)). The main complaint seems to be that students start getting lost pretty quickly because challenging concepts are explained perhaps too theoretically and not enough in plain English.

A few alternatives, some of which were suggested by students:
- [Khan Academy Linear Algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra)
- [Essence of Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) video series
- Gilbert Strang's [book](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Linear-Algebra-Gilbert-Strang/dp/0980232775/)
- Gilbert Strang's [course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/) which is already on our [extras/courses](https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science/blob/master/extras/courses.md) list

I'm open to replacing LAFF with Gilbert Strang's course, but I worry that Strang's course could be just as difficult to understand as LAFF without some introductory material. Khan Academy is also very compelling since it includes assignments. I would like to solicit more feedback from people who have experimented with these different resources to see what the best one is — which may end up being some combination of resources. Note also that a resource doesn't have to be ""all-or-nothing"" — we can say ""the first five weeks of course X and then course Y"", similar to what we did in [Intro CS](https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science#introduction-to-computer-science).

Part of what makes LAFF so attractive is the integration of programming assignments. These should be considered mandatory for anyone learning linear algebra for CS. So my inclination is to keep LAFF in the curriculum, but add a short supplement before it, like Essence of Linear Algebra.",2017-11-03T10:46:27Z,423,,,,[]

619,2017-09-02T00:12:31Z,https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/420,Introduction to Mathematical Thinking; prereq and placement,"Hi!

This issue is concerning the course _Introduction to Mathematical Thinking_, currently listed under Advanced Math. A link to the course is here: https://www.coursera.org/learn/mathematical-thinking

It's really a minor detail. The OSSU course list lists pre-calculus as a prerequisite. I'm currently enrolled in the course, and it is explicitly stated that the course has no prerequisites. Instead, it focuses on logic theory, set theory-- the foundational theories that mathematics is derived from.

This course is more a pre-college introductory course, to be taken before college algebra, for example, and to heavily improve the student's understanding of mathematics from a foundation level.

---

On that note, but this isn't something I would be sure about. The course list may benefit from moving it from Advanced Math to Core Math. As mentioned, it's intended as a pre-college course (or a remedial course, as most colleges have it listed under.) Being able to reason mathematically and understand reasonings for it, while not critical to the study of the other ones in Core Math, is highly, highly beneficial. In a university, this course would come before them-- and the completion of it then instead of later would greatly improve a student's understanding of the math that comes from other math courses, like calculus, linear algebra, those sorts of things.

Thank you for your time in reading this issue, and have a great day!

(Note: I read the 'contributing' guidelines, and believe that opening as issue for this was appropriate, as they stated. However, it also doesn't seem to be standard, as there are few open issues.

- create a blog
- Creation of small groups to help people keep motivated
- ""Hall of Fame"" - some way to reward and congratulate students that finished a course
- Emphasize the importance of [PROJECTS](https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science/blob/master/PROJECTS.md). The **true indicator** of success for us is the number of projects this file has.

All the ideas should help us to grow as a friendly and supportive community, encourage more students to join and stay with us collaborating in several ways, with projects, mentoring, writing on our blog, helping on gitter, etc.",2017-09-11T10:14:16Z,418,,,,[]

Around February, 25 I'll show a ""draft version"" of the curriculum with such modifications and we'll have some days to discuss it and finish the release that will be done next week/month.

For breaking changes (e.g. course is no longer available), we will update the curriculum any time it occurs. Other than this, the curriculum will only be updated next year.

654,2017-01-23T16:44:09Z,https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/385,Problems/suggestions with some courses,"Hi,

The [parallel computing course](http://15418.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2016/home) has homework assignments that require you to be physically present on campus. Maybe replace it with [Parallel Programming](https://www.coursera.org/learn/parprog1), which builds on the earlier Scala programming course?

I notice that the highly-acclaimed Automata course was dropped in favor of Intro the Theoretical Computer Science because Automata was no longer available. However, the Automata course is currently available here: https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/course-v1:ComputerScience+Automata+Fall2016/about

The [operating systems course](https://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=-XXv-cvA_iBDyz-ba4yDskqMDY6A1w_c) is just a series of YouTube videos, but [this class offers](https://www.ops-class.org/) offers exams and assignments. Has the latter ever been considered?

The programming paradigms section only covers statically-typed languages in functional and object-oriented variants (Scala and Java). Here is an alternative: the well-regarded three-part series ""Programming Languages"" ([A](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages), [B](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages-part-b), [C](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages-part-c)) covers statically-typed functional programming (A), dynamically-typed functional programming (B), and dynamically-typed object-oriented programming (C).

So that set of three could replace the Scala class, and the final paradigm could then be covered by the OOP Java course. This would be more complete and cohesive, with the trade-off being that it would contradict my earlier suggestion of using the Scala-based Parallel Programming course; the [Udacity course](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-parallel-programming--cs344) could be used instead in this scenario.

Finally, the [UX Design](https://www.udacity.com/course/ux-design-for-mobile-developers--ud849) course seems overly specific to mobile development (Android in particular). Why not use this more general course? https://www.coursera.org/learn/ui-design",2017-04-11T12:02:17Z,385,,,,[]

659,2016-12-13T17:59:51Z,https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/380,Suggestion,"Hello, i've been roughly following the OSS curriculum, however 2 courses bothered me a bit for different reasons.

How to code: Systematic program design just didn't work for me but for personal reasons, since the method of teaching just didn't click, and Algorithm's part 1 and 2 were far too dry for me to keep attention for as long as my usual daily routine of studies.

I replaced Systematic program design by MIT's SICP, and algorithm's is not really replaceable as most other big courses dealing with algorithms are offline, but is a course this heavy a necessity at this point? 
The knowledge is certainly important, but the algorithms course did feel to me as more of a cheat sheet than a course, i felt like there was a bridge missing between giving away the algorithms and moving between each subject.

I've found 2 courses that might be interesting options.

CS61A is along the lines of SICP, it's a course about complexity but instead of Scheme it uses Python and the teacher is pretty good, too. The classes are far more dynamic and interesting, at least they were to me, as these are subjective areas.

CS62 deals with data structures and algorithms, maybe being a good introduction to Algorithms part 1 and 2.

Links for both: 
http://cs61a.org/ 
http://datastructur.es/sp16/

Of course, these are highly subjective opinions, it's just how i felt when following these 2 courses, and these are the replacements i found, i thought it might be helpful to share them.",2017-04-11T12:01:14Z,380,,,,[]

For that reason, it is appropiate to return CS50 to our main curriculum, because at least by now, it is a Self-Paced course.

The course ""From Nand to Tetris"" will also be moved to our `extras` section, because the following message is showed in the assignment topics:

> ""Purchase course to unlock this item.""

To preserve the free experience of our program, we will also move this course to the extras section, to avoid any confusion for our students.
- [x] Move CS50 to main curriculum
- [x] Move MIT 6.00 to extras
- [x] Move From Nand to Tetris to extras
- [x] Bump the curriculum version
- [x] Add the modifications to CHANGELOG file

With this in mind, some courses will be moved to the extras section, keeping our program **really feasible**.

The main reasons for those changes are:
- keep our curriculum as concise as possible
- valorize the courses that pay more attention to teaching concepts
- Leave the in-depth courses in the extras section as specialization of the respective topics

If you are unfamiliar with FCC, it is basically a web-development curriculum online. You sign up, do some task or project and submit your work when done and progress to the next level. The projects and tasks get progressively more challenging and at the end of the curriculum you are left with valuable skills, experience and a nice portfolio of projects.

It would be great to have something like this, but instead of projects and tasks you complete MOOCs. 

Very excited about the potential for this project.

What do you guys think?

I really like that, and i try to share as much as possible of what i generate.
Though while doing CS50 i find this restriction on the submitted work:

```
    Not allowed to:
    Providing or making available solutions to problem sets to individuals who might take this course in the future.
```

which basically forbids me to share anything i do for the course. 
I could wait to finish the course to share what i do, but it says ""in the future"" so that means nopes.

What do you think about that?

I just wanted to get a discussion going regarding udemy.com. It's getting lots of bad press right now for selling pirated content. A good summary: [How Udemy Is Profiting From Piracy](https://medium.com/@robconery/how-udemy-is-profiting-from-piracy-5638b929ffca).

OSS links to no courses on Udemy, however it's featured in `README.md` as an educational platform.

Add link to  (Optional) Hack-first, fun introduction to get you confident and motivated -- Dive into Machine Learning. The point of Dive into Machine Learning is to launch you right into Prof. Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course, which is the course already linked here!

Not sure if this breaks with formatting too much but I think it would be a good contribution. With OSS and self-motivated stuff it's always good to have ways to build momentum and keep you motivated ... I designed this guide specifically to help kick-start people into doing an OSS course, with the preferred course being Prof. Andrew Ng's course, which you already recommend.

Looking forward to hearing what you think.

Thank you for this invaluable resource! As someone reared on OSS and self-taught material ... it's wonderful to find something so complete, that I can relay to interested friends.

884,2015-10-13T15:02:30Z,https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/153,Split curriculum into core and optional modules,"Based on the durations listed by each course, and that a student is encouraged to ""complete one course at a time,"" it's going to take nearly 7 _years_ for a student to complete the whole curriculum (without taking into account any additional project-based work).  This doesn't seem realistic to me.

Is it worth splitting splitting the curriculum in to ""core"" and ""optional"" modules?

The core modules would cover the basics of any CompSci education, including basic concepts, required maths, algorithms, etc, whereas the optional modules would be more like electives.  Each optional module may have pre-requisites, which may be core module or other optional modules; this is how many brick-and-mortar university courses are arranged.

This would give the student the chance to follow a path that interests them, while not requiring them to complete 7 years' study.  Given how quickly technology moves on, the other advantage is that the content of the optional modules may change much more rapidly than that of the core concepts.

889,2015-10-13T01:19:49Z,https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/148,Community Building Ideas and Discussions,"I think its about time we start thinking about building a more robust community around OSS University. I am really fond of this initiative, and I would like to see it become a very successful project. When it comes to learning online, I think one of the challenges that the MOOC revolution is facing is that online learners often times feel as if they are studying alone (despite the efforts on each platform to encourage discussions). Another issue is that many of the MOOCs being taken here are self-assessed. The problem with that is that students may not be receiving quality, frequent, and/or sufficient feedback. I think that building a community would begin to address these issues. 

The last thing we want is for someone to start the program, get halfway through a single MOOC, think that the entire curriculum is too difficult or worse that they aren't smart enough, and quit. 

I would suggest taking a look at how <a href=""http://freecodecamp.com"">FreeCodeCamp</a> went about building their community. I think that it has worked quite well so far. As I am typing this, 117,859  campers have joined FreeCodeCamp since they launched 362  days ago. How many actually complete the program, I do not know. But, I can say that I've stuck with the program in part because of how great I think the community is.

Right now we have nearly 1000 students signed up, and it would be a waste to let any of them fall by the wayside.

I notice that we currently have Gitter chat, a facebook page, and a subreddit. That's great. We could create additional gitter rooms for each section of the curriculum, perhaps begin working on a web site (I don't know if the ossu-ui project is going to be our website and mobile application), and a blog is an awesome way that students can share the materials they are finding helpful. We could also encourage local meetups as the number of students increase. These are just ideas to spark a discussion and keep in mind.

As some may have noticed, this repository's title says Computer Science and Engineering. So, I expected some hardware courses too! This covers CS courses and just the software part of CE. Is there any hardware related MOOC courses out there? Would be awesome if we had microprocessors, microcontrollers, arduino/raspberry pi programming, embedded systems, electronics, assembly programming principles, etc. I know that most of these stuff should be learned together with laboratory classes but, knowing the theoretical part is already a huge plus. And if you can afford to buy some of these stuff (in some countries they are not that expensive), you'll have the practical skills too!

I'm not complaining at all! This is an **AWESOME** project and I want to congratulate whoever had this idea. But wouldn't be awesome if we had those courses added?

But is it compatible with many MOOCs' rules that you're not allow to share answers to quizes and other exercises outside of the platform (coursera and edx have such restrictions as far as I know).
I personally would like to share my work on exercises, but I don't think that I am allowed to do it.

956,2015-10-05T17:21:49Z,https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/81,Profiles as files vs profile as comment in thread,"May I ask:

What was the reasoning behind using a comment thread for student profiles vs using markdown files in the repository?

It seems like a file in a repository is more 'tangible'...because we don't actually issue any degrees of certificates, it seems like the 'academic program' would benefit from having students in their own separate files.  This way, we can link to a file or we can embed the file on a website; sure, the comments in an issue thread can be linked, but it's not as 'tangible'.

I realize that it's probably a lot of work to approve hundreds of pull requests...which is probably why we switched to comments.

That being said, I think managing your profile should be as easy as editing a comment.  Making a pull request is not very convenient for the student or the administrators.

I propose we develop a way to make a `{student-name}.md` file from each comment in the Student Profiles thread.  And, when someone updates their comment, their file is updated, accordingly.

What do you guys think?

However, the best universities such as University of Waterloo encourage students to do internships or participate in external projects early on.

Real-world projects lets you understand how to apply your theoritical skills to the needs of the people 

As such, I would add:
- recommend students to go to local hackathons. Those are good to learn how to work with teams, how their skills are compared to other programmers, and build self-worth
- recommend students to search for 2 or 3 months internships in local startups. Often technology startups don't mind if people do not have a university degree. So having a few coursera courses could be enough
- recommend students to do simple sites or apps for local small businesses. These would be limited in time (less than 2 weeks of work) and would help understand the value of code
